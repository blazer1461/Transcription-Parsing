"
93,SP2,"you just like threw the alarm clock at the door
"
94,SP1,"I was like kept pressing buttons and then eventually it would stop but then sometimes I also hit snooze so then I would get back in bed and then it'd go off again honestly I normally just unplugged it
"
95,SP2,"And then I wouldn't notice and that's why I probably wouldn't get up the next day we'll just leave it at that
"

"
222,SP2,"But that's a good location
"
223,SP1,"that is a good locat is that the four person one
"
224,SP2,"mhm
"
225,SP2,"and I don't think nine hundred's too bad but that's six person one with the pool
"
226,SP1,"okay I don't know if that's gonna happen or not though he was like they have an open house for that today
"
227,SP1,"ew it feels like you're coughing into my ear
"
228,SP2,"hey
"
229,SP1,"But they have an open house for it today but like I asked if he was like sure that it was available for like the time we need it
"
230,SP2,"mhm
"
231,SP1,"And he was like I'm somewhat sure like I'll let you know as soon as I find out
"
232,SP1,"and like I'm not trying to go to the open house
"
233,SP2,"mm mm
"
234,SP1,"and also like if it is not as cheap as I think it is
"
235,SP2,"How would it not be
"
236,SP1,"It might not be I don't know dude it has a pool which is super unnecessary
"
237,SP2,"but also doesn't raise the hi price of the house
"
238,SP1,"I feel like it would
"
239,SP2,"Right
"
240,SP1,"I feel it would be more expensive
"
241,SP2,"mhm
"
242,SP2,"maybe we're not allowed to use it
"
243,SP1,"No it says
"
244,SP1,"pool for those hot summer days so I feel like it's not just to like be there
"
245,SP2,"that's fair
"
246,SP1,"I don't know I want him to hit me back and be like it's available and it's this cheap
"
247,SP2,"It's not a lie and it's close to Davis or closer in that direction
"
248,SP1,"It's in it's more like if you just from the bottom of Tufts went sideways
"
249,SP2,"mm
"
250,SP1,"Does that make any sense
"
251,SP2,"it's like I'm picturing near the round about now
"
252,SP1,"Yeah it's like if from the round about you went like
"
253,SP1,"Away from tufts but not downwards towards Davis like to the right
"
254,SP2,"like towards the pub
