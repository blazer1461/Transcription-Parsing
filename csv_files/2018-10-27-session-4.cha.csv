238,SP2,"and it was like such like a low key like assignment it was like for every reading we had to do one
"
239,SP1,"mhm
"
240,SP1,"mhm
"
241,SP2,"but it stressed me out so much cause like you have to like respond to other people's and it has to be really Good and Yeah so anxiety can Canvas is associated with anxiety

250,SP1,"i know
"
251,SP2,"because I think it's really large

292,SP1,"but yeah
"
293,SP2,"um I have one piece of advice if you think you like psychology
"
294,SP1,"mhm

295,SP2,"and you might want to major in it you should like take um the required classes that like might overlap with other fields that you'd be interested in as soon as possible
"
296,SP1,"Okay
"
297,SP2,"You know
"
298,SP1,"alright yeah
"
299,SP2,"like you don't have to like dive into all the like psych major requirements
"
300,SP1,"Yeah
"
301,SP2,"like if you're not sure but like there's a lot of things that overlap between similar things and you could start with those
"
302,SP1,"That is good advice
"
303,SP2,"Thank you thank you very much
"
304,SP1,"but yeah no uh I don't any classes you recommend taking
"
305,SP2,"I don't know um I'd like in like my favorite classes are ones that have like a lot of prerecs like for my major
"
306,SP1,"Yep
"
307,SP2,"and so it's really annoying because like You have to like be in the major to take it

"
975,SP2,"Please give me back my big tables
