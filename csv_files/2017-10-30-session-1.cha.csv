"
118,SP1,"Yeah yeah uh 
"
119,SP2,"I have a lot of respect for that because of the amount that I would be bad at it 
"
120,SP2,"would be astronomical hhh 
"
121,SP1,"I bet you could do it I mean it's honestly just like memorizing patterns and then applying those patterns to other things and like once you understand like how something 
"
122,SP2,"↑That does make it sound pretty good 
"
123,SP1,"Yeah so like once you learn how to play the biology game 

"
136,SP2,"Yeah 
"
137,SP1,"Reading and writing 

"
139,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
140,SP1,"Uhhuh 
"
141,SP2,"But I don't know if I'm gonna have to be writing in the same way that I write now 
"
142,SP1,"Uhhuh 
"
143,SP2,"And mainly I have to also say that cuz if this is out there I really need to talk about the fact that I do like consulting 
"
144,SP1,"Yeah yeah yeah 
"
145,SP2,"Yeah 
"
146,SP1,"Can you actually explain like why consulting firms hire students directly out of college like ∇who presumably don't have the experience of the∇ people that they're consulting for like that's something that's 
"
147,SP2,"Yeah 
"
148,SP1,"I think is an interesting phenomenon 
"
149,SP2,"Probably just because uh we're cheaper 
"
150,SP1,"Okay 
"
151,SP2,"Than An actual Experienced hire 
"
152,SP1,"That makes sense 

"
154,SP1,"That's what I've always thought hhh 
"
155,SP2,"Yeah it means the word itself means definitely nothing because it could mean anything 
"
156,SP1,"Okay 
"
157,SP2,"I mean if I was telling my dad which shoe to put on I'd be consulting him 
"
158,SP1,"Right fair 
"
159,SP2,"But um a lot of people say the job of the consultant is to take someone's watch off their arm and tell them what time it is 
"
160,SP1,"Okay 
"
161,SP2,"I I mean I don't know if that's true or not cuz I I did it last summer but I don't really know what it's like 

"
166,SP1,"mhm 
"
167,SP2,"and your only job is to learn and the idea is that a third party who is supposed to be smart from a good college 
"
168,SP1,"That's cool 
"
169,SP1,"mhm 
"
170,SP2,"will be able to have some insight into what someone else is doing 

"
172,SP2,"maybe they're too engrossed to be able to see 
"
173,SP1,"Oh okay 
"
174,SP2,"So you get to have a lot of experience in a lot of t different industries 
"
175,SP1,"That's cool 

"
317,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
318,SP1,"Mhm 
"
319,SP2,"and they don't want it to be sold to anyone else my dad will go in and be like ↑errerererer 
"
320,SP2,"Hhh and pretty much make sure that Merck uh keeps their patent and that Pfizer can't sell whatever they sold 
"
321,SP1,"Wow 
"
322,SP2,"Yeah which there are 
"
323,SP1,"That's interesting 
"
324,SP2,"Societal benefits but mainly societal downsides too 
"
325,SP1,"Yeah I guess so I mean 
"
326,SP1,"Drug companies are interesting and like a tough thing for me to wrap my head around because like 
"
327,SP2,"Yeah 
"
328,SP1,"their bottom line like yes they're bettering the world with medicine but 
"
329,SP2,"Yeah so much of its insane profit driven 
"
330,SP1,"They're also so much about profit yeah 
"
331,SP2,"Yeah 
"
332,SP1,"Which is everything honestly like even being a doctor like 
"
333,SP2,"Yeah 
"
334,SP1,"You go into work 
"
335,SP2,"That's true 
"
336,SP1,"Probably 
"
337,SP1,"at least partially because you're getting paid for it and like 
"
338,SP2,"Yeah 
"
339,SP2,"is a high it's a good paying job 
"
340,SP1,"Yeah 
"
341,SP2,"But to me it's like a job where it's like good paying but you're doing actually so much good 
"
342,SP1,"Yeah 
"
343,SP2,"Every day 
"
344,SP1,"Hopefully hopefully 
"
345,SP2,"Yeah 
"
346,SP2,"Yeah 
"
347,SP1,"That's the goal 
"
348,SP2,"I mean my dad l my dad's like 
"
349,SP2,"Amazingly weirdly smart 
"
350,SP1,"uh huh 
"
351,SP2,"he's like a history major 
"
352,SP1,"Yeah 
"
353,SP2,"And is doing things with science somehow 
"
354,SP1,"Yeah that's amazing 
"
355,SP2,"That make no sense to me so 
"
356,SP1,"That's really cool wow 
"
357,SP2,"He probably gets he gets a kick out of that part of it 
"
358,SP1,"Yeah I'm sure 
"
359,SP2,"Yeah 
"
360,SP1,"I mean I guess it's something good to look forward to that even though like we're academic our academic career kind of is ending soon like we're still gonna to be learning and changing and 
"
361,SP2,"Which is weird yeah 
"
362,SP2,"yeah i just wanna yeah i don't really want that to stop 
"
363,SP1,"Get into different fields 
"
364,SP2,"Yeah 
"
365,SP1,"Yeah yeah yeah like um two summers ago I worked at a coffee shop in San Francisco um 
"

"
368,SP2,"Yeah 
"
369,SP1,"umm a very strict coffee shop like I had to wear a tie to work and 
"
370,SP2,"Oh really in San Francisco 
"
371,SP1,"I actually 
"
372,SP1,"yeah and I actually got fired on like my last week which is like a whole nother complicated story but um like I would get anxious and stressed out and like unhappy because I wasn't like thinking and like 
"

"
374,SP2,"Yeah 
"
375,SP2,"Yeah 
"
376,SP1,"I like think that I need to have a certain baseline level of like academic stress at all times or else I like have all this stress ya 
"
377,SP2,"Yeah that's that's why I want to do consulting yeah 
"
378,SP2,"it's like the closest thing I can think of to college 
"
379,SP1,"Yeah 
"
380,SP2,"Without still being a college 
"
381,SP1,"Yeah 
"
382,SP2,"Yeah even if it's just perpetual finals period hehe forever hehe 
"
383,SP1,"Fair 
"
384,SP2,"Yeah 
"
385,SP1,"At least you'll like be in it together I assume like will you be working on a team like all consulting together as a team 
"
386,SP2,"Yeah 
"
387,SP2,"Oh yeah and it's great because it's gonna be all kids my age too 
"
388,SP1,"That's really awesome 
"
389,SP2,"For at least who I come in with 
"
390,SP1,"Yeah yeah 
"
391,SP2,"Yeah 
"
392,SP1,"so do they do like some sort of Rotational program to get you on track to know how to consult or how does that work 
"
393,SP2,"They'll probably just throw me on a project 
"
394,SP1,"Wow 
"
395,SP2,"And that's actually that's what I did this summer 
"
396,SP1,"Okay 
"
397,SP2,"And yeah this summer was actually uh I worked at place called Cap Gemini in DC 
"
398,SP1,"Oh okay I think I've heard of that 
"
399,SP2,"And I had never heard of it but apparently it's like two hundred thousand people and I was like eh 
"
400,SP1,"Nice 
"
401,SP2,"I was I don't even know how I got it actually I don't remember heheh 
"
402,SP2,"But 
"
403,SP1,"I'm sure you worked hard to get it hhh 
"
404,SP2,"Yeah 
"
405,SP2,"But it was just pretty much I they gave us a project where it's like a we work for the government and it said find a government agency and fix it 
"
406,SP1,"Okay 
"
407,SP1,"Wow 
"
408,SP2,"Or fix a problem they have yeah 
"
409,SP1,"Okay I'm sure there's a lot of those 
"
410,SP2,"And 
"
411,SP2,"actually I wa I ended up working for the biotechnology regulatory service 
"
412,SP1,"Oh cool 
"
413,SP2,"so I worked with ↑bio stuff 
"
414,SP1,"nice nice 
"
415,SP2,"Yeah hehe 
"
416,SP1,"Wow how do you like it 
"
417,SP2,"It was first I I worked on a team with the a girl named Jing who was out of her mind brilliant but didn't speak any english 
"
418,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
419,SP2,"and I worked with a teammate named John who worked remotely in Indianapolis 
"
420,SP1,"mhmm 
"
421,SP1,"Hmm 
"
422,SP1,"Oh wow 
"
423,SP2,"So we were and I was project leader so at first we were incredibly discombobulated 
"
424,SP1,"Wow 
"
425,SP1,"Yeah 
"
426,SP2,"Because none of us could communicate in the same area 
"
427,SP1,"That's nuts 
"
428,SP2,"But just through Skype happy hours inaudible Jing was a homie so I sat next to Jing every day 
"
429,SP1,"Uhhuh 
"
430,SP2,"and we had a good time 
"
431,SP1,"That's nice 
"
432,SP2,"But eventually I I we were looking up everything on the websites for this 
"
433,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
434,SP2,"and it was all saying the opposite shit for everything 
"
435,SP1,"Okay 
"
436,SP2,"So I just started calling like the emergency hotline number at BRS and I was like ↑Hey there's no →emergency but I ↑really need to speak to →someone heheh 
"
437,SP1,"That's crazy and did they connect you with someone 
"
438,SP2,"Yeah 
"
439,SP2,"and it 
"
440,SP2,"eventually they put me in touch with this guy named doctor Able who I talked to like every day 
"
441,SP1,"Okay 
"
442,SP2,"About what was I told him I'm like ↑oh I'm a student at tufts I'm just hh really hh interested in it 
"
443,SP1,"Okay 
"
444,SP1,"Oh my gosh do the did they know that you were consulting and fixing your problems 
"
445,SP2,"No 
"
446,SP1,"Their problems that's really interesting 
"
447,SP2,"I felt really bad about that heh 
"
448,SP1,"That's really int so how are you allowed to do that or like who hired you how does that work 
"
449,SP2,"Well eventually that we put together this entire huge presentation on it was pretty much whenever let's say Monsanto who's a uh 
"
450,SP1,"Yeah 
"
451,SP2,"Yeah 
"
452,SP1,"Yeah 
"
453,SP2,"So let's say they want to change a plant 
"
454,SP1,"Mhm 
"
455,SP2,"and make it drought resistant 
"
456,SP1,"Uhuh 
"
457,SP2,"Then they're gonna try to augment it in some way with a new phenotype or some type of genetic enhancing 
"
458,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
459,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
460,SP2,"but whenever they go out and experiment it with in the open BRS is gonna go and test everything they're doing to make sure it's not harming the environment 
"
461,SP1,"Okay 
"
462,SP2,"The only thing is they might be like thirty thousand sites across the US and BRS incites them randomly 
"
463,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
464,SP1,"Okay 
"
465,SP2,"Which doesn't make much sense 
"
466,SP1,"Yeah 
"
467,SP2,"So I was saying you know if we just have I got all this data and I created all these models that say 
"
468,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
469,SP1,"Uhuh 
"
470,SP2,"pretty much there are more uh focused ways we can do this based on risk 
"
471,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
472,SP2,"and you can go for certain different plant types that you know are more risky 
"
473,SP1,"Hm 
"
474,SP1,"Huh 
"
475,SP2,"And then eliminate half the agency's costs and make it way more efficient and actually purposeful to help 
"
476,SP1,"Cool 
"
477,SP2,"a the environment 
"
478,SP1,"Yeah 
"
479,SP2,"So then we just kinda package this and we gave it to uh I think we may have sent it back to doctor Able but I left for that part hh 
"
480,SP1,"Wow 
"
481,SP1,"Wow so do you think they're gonna implement it 
"
482,SP2,"I hope so it makes a ton of sense 
"
483,SP1,"It does 
"
484,SP2,"Yeah 
"
485,SP1,"Yeah 
"
486,SP2,"After going out to the real world I realized like so many things are unecessarily shitty or like extremely poorly run 
"
487,SP1,"hhh I agree I ↗agree yeah 
"
488,SP2,"And it's just like aw 
"
489,SP1,"And like way too complicated 
"
490,SP2,"Man 
"
491,SP2,"Yehah 
"
492,SP1,"And also like I have a theory that no one actually knows what they're doing 
"
493,SP2,"I think that's pretty accurate 
"
494,SP1,"Like how do you learn what you're doing I don't know it's just hhh ya I yeah 
"
495,SP2,"Yeah I have this increasing view that it's pretty much like children
"
496,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
497,SP2,"but we just get bigger and start to try to like hh run the world pretty much 
"
498,SP1,"Right 
"
499,SP1,"Right right and have to be leaders but like 
"
500,SP2,"But 
"
501,SP2,"yeah 
"
502,SP1,"= Are we even qualified for that 
"
503,SP2,"am yeah so much of it doesn't make so much of finance or even consulting is jargon to confuse laymen To think what we're doing is really Smart 
"
504,SP1,"Mhm hm 
"
505,SP1,"Same thing with medicine 
"
506,SP1,"Yep 
"
507,SP2,"Yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like 
"
508,SP1,"Mhmm 
"
509,SP2,"Yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like make a model 
"
510,SP1,"yeah 
"
511,SP2,"And figure it out 
"
512,SP1,"Yeah 
"
513,SP2,"Yeah 
"
514,SP1,"Hh but it works 
"
515,SP2,"Yeah I guess it does work hh 
"
516,SP1,"I mean 
"
517,SP2,"Yeah 
"
518,SP1,"That's really neat 
"
519,SP2,"Medicine I think is so cool 
"
520,SP1,"Hhh I also think it's so cool 
"
521,SP2,"Yeah 
"
522,SP1,"I love it umm ∇I'm very excited to ∇learn more 
"
523,SP2,"Do you know what you would be doing yet 
"
524,SP1,"Well I'm going through like phases so like = hh six months ago I was like I'm gonna be an ear nose throat doctor like that's just it that's definitely it um = but right now I'm really into GI stuff so like gastro intestinal I think that's really neat 
"
525,SP2,"Hmm 
"
526,SP1,"um I think the colon is like the coolest part of the body heheh 
"
527,SP1,"um yeah all of my friends always make fun of me like ↘Abbey says the colon is cool like →we should make a poster but 
"
528,SP2,"Hahaheh Sure 

"
531,SP2,"that would've been pretty tight 
"
532,SP2,"Yeah 
"
533,SP1,"I was actually umm Sansa Stark from game of thrones though if you watch that we had a great group costume 
"
534,SP2,"Oh nice 
"
535,SP1,"Um yeah so that's kind of the plan right now I don't know I want to do colonoscopies and like endoscopies and 
"
536,SP2,"Yeah 
"
537,SP1,"Like fix people's stomach issues 
"
538,SP2,"You should have someone nice doing a colonoscopy we need like more probably like the nicest of possible doctors doing colonoscopies 
"
539,SP1,"Yeah right hehehe 
"
540,SP2,"Hh yeah 
"
541,SP1,"Hh yeah definitely 
"

"
543,SP2,"I've yeah ∇my grandpa had colon cancer∇ so I actually think I have to get one  for which I'm = really not looking forward to much 
"
544,SP1,"Mm 
"
545,SP1,"Mm 
"
546,SP2,"= But yeah 

"
555,SP2,"That's better 
"
556,SP1,"Yeah 
"
557,SP2,"That'd be a much mor intimate relationship 
"
558,SP1,"that's much better 
"
559,SP1,"Yeah yeahha 
"
560,SP2,"otherwise yeah 
"
561,SP1,"although I think some people opt to stay weak and like watch it on the screen which like 
"
562,SP2,"Huh 
"
563,SP1,"Is interesting to see your own insides on a screen I can't even imagine what that would feel like 
"
564,SP2,"Hm 
"
565,SP2,"Yeah I'd just be like Doc you don't wanna go in there hehhe 
"
566,SP1,"Yeah haha 
"
567,SP1,"Yeah it's nuts but anyway uh when you were talking about like do working for the government with the Monsanto stuff like my mom does a lot of um she used to do like genetic modification for um MeadWestvaco 
"
568,SP2,"Okay 
"
569,SP1,"and they were working on making like more efficient trees 
"
570,SP2,"That's really cool 
"
571,SP1,"But 
"
572,SP1,"now she does like kind of the opposite she does water 
"
573,SP2,"yeah 
"
574,SP2,"Make trees less efficient 
"
575,SP1,"Hehe no no no um she's like the government monitoring she has her own water testing business so she's like monitoring construction companies to making sure = make sure that they're not 
"
576,SP2,"Hmm 
"
577,SP1,"like 
"
578,SP2,"That's a societally useful useful job 
"
579,SP1,"Polluting water 
"
580,SP1,"yeah it's really cool and it's like her own little start up business but 
"
581,SP2,"That's really cool 
"
582,SP1,"I was always like raised in this house where we were like really cool with like GMOs and like genetic modification and like 
"
583,SP2,"Yeah 
"
584,SP2,"I don't really know I feel like everything is kind of GMO based casue I mean how I feel like it doesn't really matter something genetically modified because nature genetically modifies everything anyway 
"
585,SP1,"That's a good view point 
"
586,SP2,"So the stigmatation against it I don't really understand 
"
587,SP1,"Yeah 
"
588,SP2,"Yeah I feel like fertilizer that stuff or not fertilizers but uh whatever the chemicals pesticides pesticides I'd be more like 
"
589,SP1,"Yeah pesticides 
"
590,SP2,"= We shouldn't ⇗do that 
"
591,SP1,"Right right like I'd rather 
"
592,SP2,"Yeah 
"
593,SP1,"Genetically modify something to be resistant 
"
594,SP2,"Yeah then have to give it pesticides to make it okay 
"
595,SP1,"Yeah 
"
596,SP2,"Yeah 
"
597,SP1,"Yeah I mean I guess it's like really complicated because we don't fully know what everything does to our body at this point 
"
598,SP2,"Yeah 
"
599,SP1,"So like I don't know we We yeah we're just 
"
600,SP2,"Stick with oreos 

612,SP1,"Yeah but I like ice cream too much but now they have vegan ice cream so 
"
613,SP2,"Yeah the problem for me is that the difference between vegan and vegetarian is too hard for me to remember so I don't think I could be a good either of them so there's just no way 
"
614,SP1,"Really you can't remember 
"
615,SP2,"No so there's just no way I could ever do it it's too complicated 

"
625,SP2,"Yeah 
"
626,SP1,"I'm pretty good at understanding other dietary restrictions 
"
627,SP1,"like working on them 
"
628,SP2,"That's pretty good I pretty much make the same thing for dinner Every day 
"

630,SP2,"Just like chicken with avocado and like arugula tomatoes mushroom 
"
631,SP1,"That sounds really good for you 

638,SP2,"and asking them about their lives and what they do 
"
639,SP1,"Four hundred 
