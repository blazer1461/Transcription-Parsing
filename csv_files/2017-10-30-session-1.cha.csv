5,SP2,"I had to drive here really quick
"
6,SP1,"Me too me too I like

8,SP1,"Looked at my agenda and saw that this was at two hundred Boston Ave and I was like oh well guess I'm not walking
"
9,SP2,"Yeah I have another one too at
"
10,SP1,"Can't do that
"
11,SP2,"The regular psych building
"
12,SP1,"Okay
"
13,SP2,"I think at eleven or eleven fifteen
"
14,SP1,"Oh wow nice

22,SP2,"Uh actually I'm going into consulting next year
"
23,SP1,"Oh nice so you already know
"
24,SP2,"Yeah
"
25,SP1,"Cool this tea is like a little too hot
"
26,SP2,"I'm pretty sure the milk was actually bad
"
27,SP1,"inaudible
"
28,SP2,"So I don't wanna say anything though
"
29,SP1,"really
"
30,SP1,"oh that's so gross
"
31,SP2,"But it like flaked off and I smelled it and it was gross so was just like
"
32,SP1,"Did you put it in your
"
33,SP2,"No
"
34,SP1,"I wonder if that's part of the experiment
"
35,SP2,"I was thinking that the whole time like ⇗what is part of the expehriment laughs
"
36,SP1,"Yeah there was one time that I was tricked for one of these for intro to psych
"
37,SP2,"Oh really
"
38,SP1,"Yeah um like the other participant was actually a plant
"
39,SP1,"So like when I first came in and saw you I thought that you were a plant hehehe
"
40,SP1,"yeah that was pretty rough but anyway so you're gonna do consulting where is that gonna be
"
41,SP2,"Luckily in Boston
"
42,SP1,"Nice
"
43,SP2,"Yeah
"
44,SP2,"I I'm so uh I'm not sure if you know anything about consulting but
"
45,SP1,"Like a little
"
46,SP2,"Yeah I I unfortunately do
"
47,SP1,"Okay
"
48,SP2,"But um I'm choosing between a firm called Oliver Weinmann and another one called Deloitte so I
"
49,SP1,"Oh yeah I know Deloitte
"
50,SP2,"Yeah I just have to make make a decision at some point in the next week
"
51,SP1,"I've heard of that
"
52,SP1,"Yeah
"
53,SP1,"geez
"
54,SP2,"Although I assume
"
55,SP1,"congrats
"
56,SP2,"yeah it's funny cuz I'm an English major
"
57,SP1,"Right
"
58,SP2,"And I could not be dumber at eighty percent of the stuff that you need for consulting
"
59,SP1,"but cuz it don't they like ask you stuff during the interview like How many marbles will fit in an airplane
"
60,SP2,"Oh yeah
"
61,SP2,"It's a ton of math and I can't I'm in psych stats for my math requirement
"
62,SP1,"Yeah
"
63,SP1,"So like clearly not
"
64,SP2,"Yeah
"
65,SP1,"Like a math person
"
66,SP2,"It's so bad I had some guy ask me I was doing it's you do these things called mark uh market sizing where they'll ask you how many cabs are let's say in New York City
"
67,SP1,"Okay
"
68,SP1,"Okay
"
69,SP2,"And you just have to figure it out from mentally
"
70,SP1,"Yeah
"
71,SP2,"Thinking about all these factors and I had to do something like seven times forty two hundred and I looked at the guy and I was like look thehhre's not an answer ⁎I don't know⁎ I'm gonna be honest hehe And he was like okay
"
72,SP1,"That's so stressful but you got it that's kind of cool
"
73,SP2,"Yeah seven yeah that that was a different one but somehow that went okay
"
74,SP1,"Wow
"
75,SP1,"Nice
"
76,SP2,"Yeah you meet the ust you meet the oddest people
"
77,SP1,"Uhuh
"
78,SP2,"For like for that one I completely fucked up every part of it but the whole day they were saying you know we have this guy named Hank he's brilliant he's your last interview they're like our clients can't get enough of Hank and then this guy waddles in in the end
"
79,SP1,"Mhm
"
80,SP2,"and he's like clearly neurotic he's got like overlapping bottom teeth and he has my resume and he keeps flipping it over and over even know hh there's nothing on the back
"
81,SP1,"mhm
"
82,SP1,"Oh my god I can't I like know exactly the kind of person you're talking
"
83,SP2,"And I'm thinking like holy shit
"
84,SP2,"yeah
"
85,SP1,"About
"
86,SP2,"And then he's like alright I'm gonna give you a graph and I want you to solve it so he writes this graph with like eleven different lines going LATCH
"
87,SP1,"mhm
"
88,SP2,"and he's like all right solve this and I'm like I don't know what the fuck I'm looking at
"
89,SP2,"so I start making shit up and he's like that's all wrong and then he takes it back and he's like I drew it wrong he crosses everything out gives me like another eleven lines and I'm like dude I can't read it and he's like ⁎of course⁎
"
90,SP2,"And he takes it back does anoth nother one a new one and gives it to me and I was like I and he's like you know what I drew it wrong again and I was like okay
"
91,SP1,"Did he ever draw it right
"
92,SP2,"No he was like let's just do let's just talk haheheh
"
93,SP1,"I wonder if that was part of the test
"
94,SP2,"I think he's just c uh my idea is that he goes into a conference room everyday
"
95,SP1,"mhm
"
96,SP2,"And gets like everything wrong and everyone at the company is like ⁎he's brilliant he's done it again⁎ hehe
"
97,SP1,"That's so crazy wow haha
"
98,SP2,"He's my idol it was like it was a firm calledl Novantis and it's extremely analytical
"
99,SP1,"Okay
"
100,SP2,"Modeling for finance
"
101,SP1,"Okay
"
102,SP2,"Which is pretty much like the absolute opposite of what I'd be good at
"
103,SP1,"Okay
"
104,SP2,"But he's a philosophy major
"
105,SP1,"Oh cool
"
106,SP2,"And he's like a huge partner at it and I was like you're ↓my hero
"
107,SP1,"That's awesome
"
108,SP2,"Yeah
"
109,SP1,"I'm a big proponent of people just like majoring in whatever they like and then just doing something else random with it
"
110,SP2,"Yeah
"
111,SP1,"Um that's kind of what I'm doing with anthropology I think like just I'm not gonna do anything with anthropology probably in my future but I like it
"
112,SP2,"Oh really
"
113,SP2,"What was the other one biology
"
114,SP1,"So
"
115,SP1,"biology
"
116,SP2,"That's a pretty good one to have
"
117,SP1,"Yeah yeah uh
"
118,SP2,"I have a lot of respect for that because of the amount that I would be bad at it
"
119,SP2,"would be astronomical hhh
"
120,SP1,"I bet you could do it I mean it's honestly just like memorizing patterns and then applying those patterns to other things and like once you understand like how something
"
121,SP2,"That does make it sound pretty good
"
122,SP1,"Yeah so like once you learn how to play the biology game
"
123,SP2,"Yeah
"
124,SP1,"like you're good it's like orgo like
"
125,SP2,"for English once you know how to read you're set
"
126,SP1,"see that's what I'm struggling with right now oh my god I
"
127,SP2,"you're really good haha haha
"
128,SP1,"Oh my god I am questioning my like general reading comprehension comprehension I have to like present on these two like uh one ten page reading and one twenty page reading for my class on Wednesday I spent literally all of Saturday trying to read these thirty pages and I just like and they were so simple they were like ethnographic just like a story and I was just like so I don't know I I think like I'm a senior in college but I still like can't comprehend readings
"
129,SP2,"Do you ever have to write essays for any of your classes
"
130,SP1,"Anthropology all the time
"
131,SP2,"Oh okay
"
132,SP1,"So
"
133,SP2,"There you go
"
134,SP1,"I mean I used to be able to do it I think somewhere like within the past six months I just like forgot how to do
"
135,SP2,"Yeah
"
136,SP1,"Reading and writing
"
137,SP2,"That's my fear is that I'll graduate I'm gonna go into uh consulting which I find really interesting
"
138,SP1,"mhm
"
139,SP1,"Uhhuh
"
140,SP2,"But I don't know if I'm gonna have to be writing in the same way that I write now
"
141,SP1,"Uhhuh
"
142,SP2,"And mainly I have to also say that cuz if this is out there I really need to talk about the fact that I do like consulting
"
143,SP1,"Yeah yeah yeah
"
144,SP2,"Yeah
"
145,SP1,"Can you actually explain like why consulting firms hire students directly out of college like ∇who presumably don't have the experience of the∇ people that they're consulting for like that's something that's
"
146,SP2,"Yeah
"
147,SP1,"I think is an interesting phenomenon
"
148,SP2,"Probably just because uh we're cheaper
"
149,SP1,"Okay
"
150,SP2,"Than An actual Experienced hire
"
151,SP1,"That makes sense
"
152,SP2,"yeah also I think to b like consulting itself means absolutely nothing
"
153,SP1,"That's what I've always thought hhh
"
154,SP2,"Yeah it means the word itself means definitely nothing because it could mean anything
"
155,SP1,"Okay
"
156,SP2,"I mean if I was telling my dad which shoe to put on I'd be consulting him
"
157,SP1,"Right fair
"
158,SP2,"But um a lot of people say the job of the consultant is to take someone's watch off their arm and tell them what time it is
"
159,SP1,"Okay
"
160,SP2,"I I mean I don't know if that's true or not cuz I I did it last summer but I don't really know what it's like
"
161,SP1,"Cool
"
162,SP2,"To do for couple years
"
163,SP1,"Uhhuh
"
164,SP2,"I just think you get to learn so much about so many different industries
"
165,SP1,"mhm
"
166,SP2,"and your only job is to learn and the idea is that a third party who is supposed to be smart from a good college
"
167,SP1,"That's cool
"
168,SP1,"mhm
"
169,SP2,"will be able to have some insight into what someone else is doing
"
170,SP1,"mhm
"
171,SP2,"maybe they're too engrossed to be able to see
"
172,SP1,"Oh okay
"
173,SP2,"So you get to have a lot of experience in a lot of t different industries
"
174,SP1,"That's cool
"
175,SP2,"So yeah for that stuff I think it's gonna be really fun
"
176,SP1,"Yeah that is gonna be fun
"
177,SP2,"But
"
178,SP2,"I've also heard my hours are from ↓seven AM to twelve AM so
"
179,SP1,"Nice
"
180,SP2,"Might be tough for me
"
181,SP1,"Yeah okay well you just won't have a social life but weekends
"
182,SP2,"uh yeah no I think so I usually you're supposed to travel Monday through Thursday but I am gonna be living with my Twelve best friends from college probably
"
183,SP1,"Okay
"
184,SP1,"Oh what wow all in ∇one house∇
"
185,SP2,"Probably that's what I want yeah haha
"
186,SP1,"Oh my god
"
187,SP2,"In Boston
"
188,SP1,"That's gonna be amazing and probably the only way you can afford to live in Boston
"
189,SP2,"So
"
190,SP2,"Yeah we're probably going to have to live in like Sommerville hehe
"
191,SP1,"Yeah
"
192,SP2,"Yeah
"
193,SP1,"That's awesome wow that's really cool that you're all ending up in Boston because like right now
"
194,SP2,"Yeah
"
195,SP1,"All of my friends are like okay New York Boston Chicago San Francisco like Kind of all
"
196,SP2,"Yeah it's also scares like all your friends like when are you gonna see them again if you don't live with them
"
197,SP1,"I know
"
198,SP1,"I know
"
199,SP2,"yeah
"
200,SP1,"it what's so weird is that like next we have to make adult friends
"
201,SP2,"I don't wanna do that I'm not gonna do it
"
202,SP1,"Okay that's it sounds hard I mean this summer like I was in Boston but like you know like I had friends here but they were coming and going so there would be like a week where like three my friends would be out of town and
"
203,SP2,"Yeah
"
204,SP1,"I like find found myself like trying to make work friends but like how can you make work friends like I was at a really weird level where like I spent a lot of time working with my bosses and then a lot of time working with people who are under me but like no one really on my level
"
205,SP2,"Oh that's rough yeah
"
206,SP1,"So
"
207,SP1,"it was like who am I friends with or like how do I form relationships that aren't just professional
"
208,SP2,"Yeah
"
209,SP2,"That is tough
"
210,SP1,"That's kind of weird
"
211,SP2,"Yeah luckily u uh everyone at most people I worked with were our age LATCH
"
212,SP1,"That's nice
"
213,SP2,"Yeah and one kid was just he's brilliant at math but he was a meth addict and went to a Buddhist monastery to get clean he goes to MIT
"
214,SP1,"What haha that's so crazy
"
215,SP2,"He's like hopped up on he came to my house last week for a party and he comes up to me and he's like yeah dude I'm hopped up on valium right now and I was like dude you've had like eight beers
"
216,SP1,"People are wacky heheha
"
217,SP2,"and he was like yeah I hope nothing bad happens haha like ⇗you gotta get a get out of my house heheh
"
218,SP1,"Oh my god that's nuts hhh
"
219,SP2,"But all summer he'd be like wake up have McDonald's uh lunch he would have Taco Bell and he would like have Wendy's at night he would have like eight cups of coffee
"
220,SP1,"Oh my god
"
221,SP2,"Couple beers during work
"
222,SP1,"Oh my god
"
223,SP2,"and then he would smoke in the morning and at night hh
"
224,SP1,"Oh my god
"
225,SP2,"Everyday
"
226,SP2,"he was a tank he was unreal
"
227,SP1,"That's insane
"
228,SP2,"Yeah he
"
229,SP1,"That's such a wacky person wow just thinking about that makes my stomach hurt and like
"
230,SP2,"Brilliant brilliant though I know he's gonna definitely die in like five years but before that hhhappens hh he's gonna be brilliant
"
231,SP1,"Wow it's so interesting to think how like drugs make people more or less productive or more brilliant
"
232,SP2,"Some people get really productive from it
"
233,SP1,"Yeah
"
234,SP2,"Which is odd to me
"
235,SP1,"Yeah at I was in a class last year I guess that we talked about umm bio hacking I think is what it's called in Silicon Valley
"
236,SP2,"Yeah
"
237,SP1,"Where like people are just taking so many drugs to like be more productive
"
238,SP2,"Yeah I know what you're talking about yeah
"
239,SP2,"yeah
"
240,SP2,"that would never work for me
"
241,SP1,"Yeah
"
242,SP2,"No I feel like I mean if I smoked I'd be done I'd be like all right
"
243,SP1,"Yeah
"
244,SP2,"I'm out hhh
"
245,SP1,"That's true that's true I think I have too much anxiety about like my general health and then like
"
246,SP2,"oh Yeah that's another thing I like
"
247,SP1,"What my mental state would be like
"
248,SP2,"I Yeah I just don't want to f like fuck my body up
"
249,SP1,"Right yeah
"
250,SP2,"Yeah
"
251,SP1,"yeah
"
252,SP1,"I'm pre med and like
"
253,SP2,"Oh yeah
"
254,SP1,"working in a hospital right now
"
255,SP2,"Oh that's cool
"
256,SP1,"Yeah it is really cool but I was never a hypochondriac before and now I'm like I have diabetes and I have
"
257,SP2,"That would freak me the fuck out yeah
"
258,SP1,"Like all these infections and like yeah
"
259,SP2,"Even spending a lot of time in a hospital I'd be like I must've contracted something today
"
260,SP1,"I definitely got pink eye one time from work
"
261,SP2,"Really hahah
"
262,SP1,"yeah
"
263,SP1,"it was really sad
"
264,SP2,"That's horrible
"
265,SP1,"Because I think I like do a lot of hand sanitation you know like I'm always
"
266,SP2,"Yeah
"
267,SP1,"Washing my hands but hhh still still happened hhh
"
268,SP2,"Hehe yeah that I couldn't do that
"
269,SP2,"yeah
"
270,SP1,"Yeah
"
271,SP1,"It's fun though
"
272,SP2,"That is really cool to me and this is an odd opinion I mean I think my profession will be extremely fun
"
273,SP1,"Mhm
"
274,SP2,"and I'll get to learn a lot but I viewalmost being a doctor as the only meaningful
"
275,SP1,"Mhm
"
276,SP1,"Ohh
"
277,SP2,"profession
"
278,SP2,"That I can think of other than being a teacher which is what I want to do in my like fifties
"
279,SP1,"Yeah
"
280,SP1,"Oh that's a really cool path
"
281,SP2,"I def yeah I definitely want to be an English teacher by the time I'm fifty I wanna like pay for my kids colleges by the time I'm forty five
"
282,SP1,"Mhm
"
283,SP1,"Yeah
"
284,SP2,"And then immediately become an English teacher
"
285,SP1,"Smart very smart yeah cuz you can't do that starting with English teaching Probably or it
"
286,SP2,"Yeah
"
287,SP2,"I cannot
"
288,SP1,"it will be a lot harder I guess
"
289,SP2,"Yeah the jump from English teacher to consulting will be much more difficult
"
290,SP1,"Yeah yeah hhh
"
291,SP2,"Yeah hhh
"
292,SP1,"Neat
"
293,SP2,"But
"
294,SP1,"sounds like you've got a good
"
295,SP1,"Plan though
"
296,SP2,"Yeah I realize my plan will definitely fall through hhh
"
297,SP1,"Why
"
298,SP2,"Uh I feel I mean my dad wanted I think he wanted to be a history teacher when he was my age and  we are the exact same person in every way
"
299,SP1,"mhm
"
300,SP1,"mhm
"
301,SP2,"But now he's been a lawyer for like thirty years and he started out doing it for
"
302,SP1,"Oh
"
303,SP2,"People who were uh what's it like labor law
"
304,SP1,"Okay
"
305,SP2,"But now he does intellectual property law for Merck and Pfizer
"
306,SP1,"What does that mean
"
307,SP2,"Uh pretty much let's say you're Merck do you know you know uh
"
308,SP1,"Merck yeah the the drug company
"
309,SP2,"Yeah
"
310,SP2,"so let's say that they have a new drug they need to patent it so that no one else can pretty much use the same drug and that they can collect all the market from it
"
311,SP1,"mm
"
312,SP1,"mhm
"
313,SP1,"mhm
"
314,SP2,"my dad makes sure that when that patent is challenged by another company let's say Merck thinks that oh Pfizer came out with something but it's too similar to ours
"
315,SP1,"mhm
"
316,SP1,"Mhm
"
317,SP2,"and they don't want it to be sold to anyone else my dad will go in and be like errerererer
"
318,SP2,"Hhh and pretty much make sure that Merck uh keeps their patent and that Pfizer can't sell whatever they sold
"
319,SP1,"Wow
"
320,SP2,"Yeah which there are
"
321,SP1,"That's interesting
"
322,SP2,"Societal benefits but mainly societal downsides too
"
323,SP1,"Yeah I guess so I mean
"
324,SP1,"Drug companies are interesting and like a tough thing for me to wrap my head around because like
"
325,SP2,"Yeah
"
326,SP1,"their bottom line like yes they're bettering the world with medicine but
"
327,SP2,"Yeah so much of its insane profit driven
"
328,SP1,"They're also so much about profit yeah
"
329,SP2,"Yeah
"
330,SP1,"Which is everything honestly like even being a doctor like
"
331,SP2,"Yeah
"
332,SP1,"You go into work
"
333,SP2,"That's true
"
334,SP1,"Probably
"
335,SP1,"at least partially because you're getting paid for it and like
"
336,SP2,"Yeah
"
337,SP2,"is a high it's a good paying job
"
338,SP1,"Yeah
"
339,SP2,"But to me it's like a job where it's like good paying but you're doing actually so much good
"
340,SP1,"Yeah
"
341,SP2,"Every day
"
342,SP1,"Hopefully hopefully
"
343,SP2,"Yeah
"
344,SP2,"Yeah
"
345,SP1,"That's the goal
"
346,SP2,"I mean my dad l my dad's like
"
347,SP2,"Amazingly weirdly smart
"
348,SP1,"uh huh
"
349,SP2,"he's like a history major
"
350,SP1,"Yeah
"
351,SP2,"And is doing things with science somehow
"
352,SP1,"Yeah that's amazing
"
353,SP2,"That make no sense to me so
"
354,SP1,"That's really cool wow
"
355,SP2,"He probably gets he gets a kick out of that part of it
"
356,SP1,"Yeah I'm sure
"
357,SP2,"Yeah
"
358,SP1,"I mean I guess it's something good to look forward to that even though like we're academic our academic career kind of is ending soon like we're still gonna to be learning and changing and
"
359,SP2,"Which is weird yeah
"
360,SP2,"yeah i just wanna yeah i don't really want that to stop
"
361,SP1,"Get into different fields
"
362,SP2,"Yeah
"
363,SP1,"Yeah yeah yeah like um two summers ago I worked at a coffee shop in San Francisco um
"
364,SP2,"That's chill
"
365,SP1,"I was really chi actually no it wasn't very chill like It was
"
366,SP2,"Yeah
"
367,SP1,"umm a very strict coffee shop like I had to wear a tie to work and
"
368,SP2,"Oh really in San Francisco
"
369,SP1,"I actually
"
370,SP1,"yeah and I actually got fired on like my last week which is like a whole nother complicated story but um like I would get anxious and stressed out and like unhappy because I wasn't like thinking and like
"
371,SP1,"Expanding my Horizons and using my brain and
"
372,SP2,"Yeah
"
373,SP2,"Yeah
"
374,SP1,"I like think that I need to have a certain baseline level of like academic stress at all times or else I like have all this stress ya
"
375,SP2,"Yeah that's that's why I want to do consulting yeah
"
376,SP2,"it's like the closest thing I can think of to college
"
377,SP1,"Yeah
"
378,SP2,"Without still being a college
"
379,SP1,"Yeah
"
380,SP2,"Yeah even if it's just perpetual finals period hehe forever hehe
"
381,SP1,"Fair
"
382,SP2,"Yeah
"
383,SP1,"At least you'll like be in it together I assume like will you be working on a team like all consulting together as a team
"
384,SP2,"Yeah
"
385,SP2,"Oh yeah and it's great because it's gonna be all kids my age too
"
386,SP1,"That's really awesome
"
387,SP2,"For at least who I come in with
"
388,SP1,"Yeah yeah
"
389,SP2,"Yeah
"
390,SP1,"so do they do like some sort of Rotational program to get you on track to know how to consult or how does that work
"
391,SP2,"They'll probably just throw me on a project
"
392,SP1,"Wow
"
393,SP2,"And that's actually that's what I did this summer
"
394,SP1,"Okay
"
395,SP2,"And yeah this summer was actually uh I worked at place called Cap Gemini in DC
"
396,SP1,"Oh okay I think I've heard of that
"
397,SP2,"And I had never heard of it but apparently it's like two hundred thousand people and I was like eh
"
398,SP1,"Nice
"
399,SP2,"I was I don't even know how I got it actually I don't remember heheh
"
400,SP2,"But
"
401,SP1,"I'm sure you worked hard to get it hhh
"
402,SP2,"Yeah
"
403,SP2,"But it was just pretty much I they gave us a project where it's like a we work for the government and it said find a government agency and fix it
"
404,SP1,"Okay
"
405,SP1,"Wow
"
406,SP2,"Or fix a problem they have yeah
"
407,SP1,"Okay I'm sure there's a lot of those
"
408,SP2,"And
"
409,SP2,"actually I wa I ended up working for the biotechnology regulatory service
"
410,SP1,"Oh cool
"
411,SP2,"so I worked with bio stuff
"
412,SP1,"nice nice
"
413,SP2,"Yeah hehe
"
414,SP1,"Wow how do you like it
"
415,SP2,"It was first I I worked on a team with the a girl named Jing who was out of her mind brilliant but didn't speak any english
"
416,SP1,"mhm
"
417,SP2,"and I worked with a teammate named John who worked remotely in Indianapolis
"
418,SP1,"mhmm
"
419,SP1,"Hmm
"
420,SP1,"Oh wow
"
421,SP2,"So we were and I was project leader so at first we were incredibly discombobulated
"
422,SP1,"Wow
"
423,SP1,"Yeah
"
424,SP2,"Because none of us could communicate in the same area
"
425,SP1,"That's nuts
"
426,SP2,"But just through Skype happy hours inaudible Jing was a homie so I sat next to Jing every day
"
427,SP1,"Uhhuh
"
428,SP2,"and we had a good time
"
429,SP1,"That's nice
"
430,SP2,"But eventually I I we were looking up everything on the websites for this
"
431,SP1,"mhm
"
432,SP2,"and it was all saying the opposite shit for everything
"
433,SP1,"Okay
"
434,SP2,"So I just started calling like the emergency hotline number at BRS and I was like Hey there's no →emergency but I really need to speak to →someone heheh
"
435,SP1,"That's crazy and did they connect you with someone
"
436,SP2,"Yeah
"
437,SP2,"and it
"
438,SP2,"eventually they put me in touch with this guy named doctor Able who I talked to like every day
"
439,SP1,"Okay
"
440,SP2,"About what was I told him I'm like oh I'm a student at tufts I'm just hh really hh interested in it
"
441,SP1,"Okay
"
442,SP1,"Oh my gosh do the did they know that you were consulting and fixing your problems
"
443,SP2,"No
"
444,SP1,"Their problems that's really interesting
"
445,SP2,"I felt really bad about that heh
"
446,SP1,"That's really int so how are you allowed to do that or like who hired you how does that work
"
447,SP2,"Well eventually that we put together this entire huge presentation on it was pretty much whenever let's say Monsanto who's a uh
"
448,SP1,"Yeah
"
449,SP2,"Yeah
"
450,SP1,"Yeah
"
451,SP2,"So let's say they want to change a plant
"
452,SP1,"Mhm
"
453,SP2,"and make it drought resistant
"
454,SP1,"Uhuh
"
455,SP2,"Then they're gonna try to augment it in some way with a new phenotype or some type of genetic enhancing
"
456,SP1,"mhm
"
457,SP1,"mhm
"
458,SP2,"but whenever they go out and experiment it with in the open BRS is gonna go and test everything they're doing to make sure it's not harming the environment
"
459,SP1,"Okay
"
460,SP2,"The only thing is they might be like thirty thousand sites across the US and BRS incites them randomly
"
461,SP1,"mhm
"
462,SP1,"Okay
"
463,SP2,"Which doesn't make much sense
"
464,SP1,"Yeah
"
465,SP2,"So I was saying you know if we just have I got all this data and I created all these models that say
"
466,SP1,"mhm
"
467,SP1,"Uhuh
"
468,SP2,"pretty much there are more uh focused ways we can do this based on risk
"
469,SP1,"mhm
"
470,SP2,"and you can go for certain different plant types that you know are more risky
"
471,SP1,"Hm
"
472,SP1,"Huh
"
473,SP2,"And then eliminate half the agency's costs and make it way more efficient and actually purposeful to help
"
474,SP1,"Cool
"
475,SP2,"a the environment
"
476,SP1,"Yeah
"
477,SP2,"So then we just kinda package this and we gave it to uh I think we may have sent it back to doctor Able but I left for that part hh
"
478,SP1,"Wow
"
479,SP1,"Wow so do you think they're gonna implement it
"
480,SP2,"I hope so it makes a ton of sense
"
481,SP1,"It does
"
482,SP2,"Yeah
"
483,SP1,"Yeah
"
484,SP2,"After going out to the real world I realized like so many things are unecessarily shitty or like extremely poorly run
"
485,SP1,"hhh I agree I agree yeah
"
486,SP2,"And it's just like aw
"
487,SP1,"And like way too complicated
"
488,SP2,"Man
"
489,SP2,"Yehah
"
490,SP1,"And also like I have a theory that no one actually knows what they're doing
"
491,SP2,"I think that's pretty accurate
"
492,SP1,"Like how do you learn what you're doing I don't know it's just hhh ya I yeah
"
493,SP2,"Yeah I have this increasing view that it's pretty much like children
"
494,SP1,"mhm
"
495,SP2,"but we just get bigger and start to try to like hh run the world pretty much
"
496,SP1,"Right
"
497,SP1,"Right right and have to be leaders but like
"
498,SP2,"But
"
499,SP2,"yeah
"
500,SP1,"Are we even qualified for that
"
501,SP2,"am yeah so much of it doesn't make so much of finance or even consulting is jargon to confuse laymen To think what we're doing is really Smart
"
502,SP1,"Mhm hm
"
503,SP1,"Same thing with medicine
"
504,SP1,"Yep
"
505,SP2,"Yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like
"
506,SP1,"mhm
"
507,SP2,"Yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like make a model
"
508,SP1,"yeah
"
509,SP2,"And figure it out
"
510,SP1,"Yeah
"
511,SP2,"Yeah
"
512,SP1,"Hh but it works
"
513,SP2,"Yeah I guess it does work hh
"
514,SP1,"I mean
"
515,SP2,"Yeah
"
516,SP1,"That's really neat
"
517,SP2,"Medicine I think is so cool
"
518,SP1,"Hhh I also think it's so cool
"
519,SP2,"Yeah
"
520,SP1,"I love it umm ∇I'm very excited to ∇learn more
"
521,SP2,"Do you know what you would be doing yet
"
522,SP1,"Well I'm going through like phases so like  hh six months ago I was like I'm gonna be an ear nose throat doctor like that's just it that's definitely it um but right now I'm really into GI stuff so like gastro intestinal I think that's really neat
"
523,SP2,"Hmm
"
524,SP1,"um I think the colon is like the coolest part of the body heheh
"
525,SP1,"um yeah all of my friends always make fun of me like Abbey says the colon is cool like →we should make a poster but
"
526,SP2,"Hahaheh Sure
"
527,SP2,"Could've been a colon for Halloween that would've been pretty tight LATCH
"
528,SP1,"I hh should've been oh my god
"
529,SP2,"that would've been pretty tight
"
530,SP2,"Yeah
"
531,SP1,"I was actually umm Sansa Stark from game of thrones though if you watch that we had a great group costume
"
532,SP2,"Oh nice
"
533,SP1,"Um yeah so that's kind of the plan right now I don't know I want to do colonoscopies and like endoscopies and
"
534,SP2,"Yeah
"
535,SP1,"Like fix people's stomach issues
"
536,SP2,"You should have someone nice doing a colonoscopy we need like more probably like the nicest of possible doctors doing colonoscopies
"
537,SP1,"Yeah right hehehe
"
538,SP2,"Hh yeah
"
539,SP1,"Hh yeah definitely
"
540,SP1,"Yeah I mean it like everyone needs them every ten years or five years if they have an elevated risk and like
"
541,SP2,"I've yeah ∇my grandpa had colon cancer∇ so I actually think I have to get one  for which I'm really not looking forward to much
"
542,SP1,"Mm
"
543,SP1,"Mm
"
544,SP2,"But yeah
"
545,SP1,"It'll be ⇗fun
"
546,SP2,"Yeah no it will be fun
"
547,SP1,"I mean
"
548,SP1,"Like
"
549,SP2,"I'll pregame it or something hhh
"
550,SP1,"I think that's what the anesthesia's for
"
551,SP2,"Do they give you anesthesia
"
552,SP1,"Yeah yeah
"
553,SP2,"That's better
"
554,SP1,"Yeah
"
555,SP2,"That'd be a much mor intimate relationship
"
556,SP1,"that's much better
"
557,SP1,"Yeah yeahha
"
558,SP2,"otherwise yeah
"
559,SP1,"although I think some people opt to stay weak and like watch it on the screen which like
"
560,SP2,"Huh
"
561,SP1,"Is interesting to see your own insides on a screen I can't even imagine what that would feel like
"
562,SP2,"Hm
"
563,SP2,"Yeah I'd just be like Doc you don't wanna go in there hehhe
"
564,SP1,"Yeah haha
"
565,SP1,"Yeah it's nuts but anyway uh when you were talking about like do working for the government with the Monsanto stuff like my mom does a lot of um she used to do like genetic modification for um MeadWestvaco
"
566,SP2,"Okay
"
567,SP1,"and they were working on making like more efficient trees
"
568,SP2,"That's really cool
"
569,SP1,"But
"
570,SP1,"now she does like kind of the opposite she does water
"
571,SP2,"yeah
"
572,SP2,"Make trees less efficient
"
573,SP1,"Hehe no no no um she's like the government monitoring she has her own water testing business so she's like monitoring construction companies to making sure make sure that they're not
"
574,SP2,"Hmm
"
575,SP1,"like
"
576,SP2,"That's a societally useful useful job
"
577,SP1,"Polluting water
"
578,SP1,"yeah it's really cool and it's like her own little start up business but
"
579,SP2,"That's really cool
"
580,SP1,"I was always like raised in this house where we were like really cool with like GMOs and like genetic modification and like
"
581,SP2,"Yeah
"
582,SP2,"I don't really know I feel like everything is kind of GMO based casue I mean how I feel like it doesn't really matter something genetically modified because nature genetically modifies everything anyway
"
583,SP1,"That's a good view point
"
584,SP2,"So the stigmatation against it I don't really understand
"
585,SP1,"Yeah
"
586,SP2,"Yeah I feel like fertilizer that stuff or not fertilizers but uh whatever the chemicals pesticides pesticides I'd be more like
"
587,SP1,"Yeah pesticides
"
588,SP2,"We shouldn't ⇗do that
"
589,SP1,"Right right like I'd rather
"
590,SP2,"Yeah
"
591,SP1,"Genetically modify something to be resistant
"
592,SP2,"Yeah then have to give it pesticides to make it okay
"
593,SP1,"Yeah
"
594,SP2,"Yeah
"
595,SP1,"Yeah I mean I guess it's like really complicated because we don't fully know what everything does to our body at this point
"
596,SP2,"Yeah
"
597,SP1,"So like I don't know we We yeah we're just
"
598,SP2,"Stick with oreos
"
599,SP1,"did you just say stick with oreos
"
600,SP2,"Heh yeah
"
601,SP1,"Hahaha you know they're vegan
"
602,SP2,"Really
"
603,SP1,"Yeah
"
604,SP2,"Oh maybe I should've had one hehe
"
605,SP1,"Are you vegan
"
606,SP2,"No hh
"
607,SP1,"Hhh I was considering being vegan on and off for awhile
"
608,SP2,"Really
"
609,SP1,"Yeah but I like ice cream too much but now they have vegan ice cream so
"
610,SP2,"Yeah the problem for me is that the difference between vegan and vegetarian is too hard for me to remember so I don't think I could be a good either of them so there's just no way
"
611,SP1,"Really you can't remember
"
612,SP2,"No so there's just no way I could ever do it it's too complicated
"
613,SP1,"Oh
"
614,SP2,"it'd be like another level of stress
"
615,SP1,"yeah that's fair I I was vegan for one week
"
616,SP2,"hm
"
617,SP1,"freshmen year
"
618,SP2,"that's pretty good
"
619,SP1,"Maybe it was sophomore year yeah it was pretty good it was it was awesome but I I keep kosher so I already kind of like
"
620,SP2,"Oh nice
"
621,SP1,"Have this ho well like kosher style like I'm not a very strict about it but um I already like have these dietary restrictions I feel like I
"
622,SP2,"Yeah
"
623,SP1,"I'm pretty good at understanding other dietary restrictions
"
624,SP1,"like working on them
"
625,SP2,"That's pretty good I pretty much make the same thing for dinner Every day
"
626,SP1,"What is that
"
627,SP2,"Just like chicken with avocado and like arugula tomatoes mushroom
"
628,SP1,"That sounds really good for you
"
629,SP2,"It is pretty good but I always make kale or Kale in the oven
"
630,SP1,"Mm
"
631,SP2,"and this summer I actually still have a scar on my stomach because I was I had a when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do
"
632,SP1,"mhm
"
633,SP2,"I ended up calling four hundred alumni from tufts
"
634,SP1,"mhm
"
635,SP2,"and asking them about their lives and what they do
"
636,SP1,"Four hundred
"
637,SP2,"A lot of people like in consulting finance or like John Tisch and heh
"
638,SP1,"Wow that's awesome
"
639,SP2,"I just was like panicking hh
"
640,SP1,"Uh huh
"
641,SP2,"He was really funny cause the first thing he says like so do you like the library and I was like yeah I'm in it it's a great it's a great library hh
"
642,SP2,"He's like that's good that's good hehe
"
643,SP1,"It's a good library hehe
"
644,SP2,"He was like yeah but one of them got out there was some guy from I think McKenzie who was like a real hardo
"
645,SP1,"mhm
"
646,SP2,"and immediately start asking me questions about like discounted cash flows that I did not even ne really need to know for consulting
"
647,SP1,"Mhm
"
648,SP2,"but I was taking out a kale platter from the oven
"
649,SP1,"While you were on the phone with this person
"
650,SP2,"An
"
651,SP2,"yeah
"
652,SP2,"in DC and I'm shirtless cause that's why I don't want to cook otherwise
"
653,SP1,"Uhuh
"
654,SP1,"Uhuh
"
655,SP1,"okay
"
656,SP2,"And I bump into to my fridge and I pressed the thing into my stomach
"
657,SP1,"Ah haha ow
"
658,SP2,"But I realize as I do it it's incredibly unprofessional to burn your belly on a call
"
659,SP2,"So I can't scream and be like aw hh man I'm sorry I just burnt my belly hehe
"
660,SP2,"So I just had to pause and then keep talking on the phone about some ridiculous finance model
"
661,SP1,"And just never let him know
"
662,SP2,"Yeah hehe
"
663,SP1,"that's so funny
"
664,SP1,"Wow one time my dad was on the phone with the fire department because he does some like management work for them and while he was on the phone with the fire department in South Carolina he like put a plate of food in the microwave and it caught on fire hh
"
665,SP1,"And he literally had to say to the fire department like I'm sorry like I have a small fire in my home like I have to go
"
666,SP2,"They were probably like ah that's a good one heheh
"
667,SP1,"Like a
"
668,SP1,"Okay cool hh
"
669,SP1,"Yeah very silly
"
670,SP2,"That's pretty bad
"
671,SP1,"Yeah wait where are you from
"
672,SP2,"New York
"
673,SP1,"Where in
"
674,SP2,"Westchester Mamaroneck
"
675,SP1,"Oh
"
676,SP2,"yeah
"
677,SP1,"cool cool
"
678,SP1,"I'm from South Carolina
"
679,SP2,"Oh okay nice yeah
"
680,SP1,"Yeah
"
681,SP2,"yeah
"
682,SP1,"it's not I don't like it very much hh
"
683,SP2,"Heheh I'm really bad with geography so I'm not sure if I know where anywhere is on a map
"
684,SP1,"Oh okay
"
685,SP2,"I pretty much only know where New York is on a map
"
686,SP1,"Have you ever played that game where you have to like match the states to the right area or like patch match the name state to the state
"
687,SP2,"Uhh no
"
688,SP1,"It's really hard
"
689,SP2,"That would've been really helpful for me though
"
690,SP1,"Yeah
"
691,SP2,"Growing up
"
692,SP1,"My roommate and I like spent one Saturday night just like doing that for hours and we were really bad at it and then we moved on to like countries in Europe and in Asia and in Africa and
"
693,SP2,"Yeah
"
694,SP1,"like I thought like maybe I could do Europe
"
695,SP2,"Europe I could maybe do but not like East Europe I would get confused
"
696,SP1,"Yeah I know I couldn't even do western Europe like I realized I don't even know where Germany or France are which is like pretty
"
697,SP2,"Yeah
"
698,SP1,"Embarrassing hh but I haven't been there so I guess that
"
699,SP2,"I went to Berlin
"
700,SP1,"Is an excuse
"
701,SP2,"I guess a year ago today almost
"
702,SP1,"Oh wow
"
703,SP2,"which is funny
"
704,SP1,"that's cool
"
705,SP2,"yeah
"
706,SP1,"what for
"
707,SP2,"Uh my girlfriend is she studied abroad there while I was in Scotland
"
708,SP1,"Oh cool
"
709,SP2,"And we went there was this thing called suicide club which is a like big club in Berlin
"
710,SP1,"I think I've heard of it actually
"
711,SP2,"Yes it's supposed to be famous I think I don't know
"
712,SP1,"Yeah
"
713,SP1,"I don't know who I would have heard of that from
"
714,SP2,"But
"
715,SP2,"We went at like five am when it was shutting down
"
716,SP1,"mhm
"
717,SP2,"And I just like went behind the bar and grabbed a random bottle of champagne and it turned out to be like a two hundred dollar bottle of champagne
"
718,SP1,"That's really cool
"
719,SP2,"And we bought like all this cheese
"
720,SP1,"Uhhuh
"
721,SP2,"And just had an amazing
"
722,SP1,"That sounds awesome
"
723,SP2,"Yeah amazing afternoon hehehe
"
724,SP1,"Wow wow
"
725,SP2,"But it was the coolest place I've ever been I hate like I went to Amsterdam and I hated it because it was so pretty and nice and I really
"
726,SP1,"You're the first person I've heard to say that they hate Amsterdam
"
727,SP2,"It was terrible it was like pretty bridge everywhere and I was like oh god hehe
"
728,SP1,"Wow hehe
"
729,SP2,"But I really need something like gritty and like som a little garbage on the street
"
730,SP1,"Uhuh
"
731,SP2,"That I think I love which I probably more New York
"
732,SP1,"So like New York
"
733,SP1,"yeah haha
"
