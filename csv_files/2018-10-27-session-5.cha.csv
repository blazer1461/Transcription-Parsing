"
98,SP2,"my god
"
99,SP1,"but There was a fire place there
"
100,SP2,"Damn
"
101,SP1,"and it was very cozy to like sit by there
"
102,SP2,"Damn
"
103,SP1,"But then people would turn it on in the spring and it would be like really hot

"
105,SP2,"Oh my god
"
106,SP2,"that'd be a good like senior

124,SP2,"and like that
"
125,SP2,"but like that's also like like we would flood the whole school

328,SP2,"Yea
"
329,SP1,"and everything on the highway
"
330,SP2,"that's true
"
331,SP2,"yeah I know mine was like a five minute drive but um yeah I would just like have my mom drive me um and then like when I got my license I would like drive myself
"
332,SP1,"Yeah my my parents never drove me cause my dad was busy and my mom doesn't drive on highways
"
333,SP2,"Yeah
"
334,SP2,"yeah yeah we didn't even need highways but it was like it kind of sucked cause I wasn't able to drive all the time cause like I didn't have my own car I'd have my dad's car so I can like only like use it if my mom wasn't working and then my dad would take her van and I would take my dad's car
"
335,SP1,"So that and that was the only thing that worked
"
336,SP2,"Yeah
"
337,SP1,"I m so
"
338,SP2,"Yeah
"
339,SP1,"uh yeah I have like the a car that was like designated for like me and my brother even though anyone in the family would drive it
"
340,SP2,"mhm
"
341,SP1,"and um my brother couldn't drive it until like the summer But once he could it got really annoying cause I just wouldn't have the car available
"
342,SP2,"Yea
"
343,SP1,"and like in the summer it was like senior year it was like the summer after senior year So I was doing like the most driving and I was going to like the most places I'd ever like gone to before So it was like it was really annoying where I'd be like oh yeah I'm trying to go to like this friend's house this afternoon my mom's like na my brother your brother took it to football
"
344,SP2,"That that's what happened to me cause like my dad was gonna get um a new car and then his current car was gonna become mine and my brothers and like we ended up going to Europe so then we like like that money was spent on Europe but um yeah like like the whole summer I would be like oh like I need the car and then my brother would be like oh like I'm taking it
"
345,SP1,"No I need it this is my car
"
346,SP2,"and I was like no and like it sucked cause like he was older than me so he like he did get priority
"
347,SP1,"That's annoying
"
348,SP2,"and I was like ugh yeah
"
349,SP1,"I don't know now now like most of my friends just drive
"
350,SP1,"it's it's fine
"
351,SP2,"Yeah and like I had a I had a lot of friends who like had their own cars they were just drive me places
"
352,SP1,"Yeah I feel like most people in New York don't really drive around though most of the people I've talked to haven't really like gotten their licenses
"
353,SP2,"It it depends where you're from like from the city like there's no point if you're from the city there's really no point in getting your license
"
354,SP2,"cause you're not gonna drive in the city but like Long Island like
"
355,SP1,"Yea
"
356,SP1,"But like it's good to have your license
"
357,SP2,"Yea
"
358,SP1,"Sooner rather than later
"
359,SP2,"Yeah like everyone in Long Island has their license
"
360,SP1,"Yeah driving w driving on like the highways is like definitely like one of my favorite things to do
"
361,SP2,"Yeah yeah
"
362,SP1,"And like in California there's this one highway where it's it's like runs all it's sort of like runs through these like hills and it's really beautiful
"
363,SP2,"mhm
"
364,SP1,"and there's like fog rolling over them and everything so it's just like a really cool place to drive in
"
365,SP2,"Yeah
"
366,SP1,"like you can go really fast there cause there's like There's no cars
"
367,SP2,"Yeah
"
368,SP1,"and also there's no cops so you can go like way faster and they don't really care
"
369,SP1,"Um so
"
370,SP2,"Yeah yeah yeah I know it's definitely rela relaxing but like the only time I would really go no the highway is like driving from like driving to and from work I would use the highway and then like if I would just go to Jersey with my parents I would drive on the highway
"
371,SP1,"You'd do the driving for that
"
372,SP2,"Yeah well I would drive home cause usually my dad would be like um going there we'd have like we have to be there by a certain time so I'll drive but it's like stressful at night
"
373,SP1,"oh definitely
"
374,SP2,"Like because it
"
375,SP1,"night driving on the highway with a lot of cars around is really stressful
"
376,SP2,"yea
"
377,SP2,"it's like it would always like make me really anxious and it would take me like half an hour until like I got the hang of it
"
378,SP1,"Yea
"
379,SP2,"Yeah
"
380,SP2,"But like usually I'll just drive on local roads cause I never really like needed the highway
"
381,SP1,"we w
"
382,SP1,"Now it's far we would drive up to we drive up to lake taho whole lot
"
383,SP2,"mhm
"
384,SP1,"and the dri like the first half is just like long boring highway driving
"
385,SP2,"Yeah
"
386,SP1,"But the second half is like really windy like two lane highways with a lot of like giant trucks and it's like really sketchy
"
387,SP2,"mhm
"
388,SP1,"like you've got a wall on one side and like a cliff on the other it's like really freaky
"
389,SP2,"Yeah
"
390,SP1,"And um like I I learned how to do that driving eventually and it was it's you need to be like focused and locked in like twenty four seven when you're doing that
"
391,SP2,"yeah and like I just like I tend to like zone out when I'm driving it either like I like pay attention to music or I'll just like relax too much
"
392,SP1,"Yeah I can't do that
"
393,SP2,"So like highway driving like I'm like I need to pay attention to everything happening
"
394,SP1,"mhm And when you're doing it at night you like get you get drowsy
"
395,SP2,"Yeah yea
"
396,SP2,"so like my dad like he like n he never really let me drive on the highway unless he was with me or if my mom was with me like I wouldn't be allowed to drive on the highway by myself
"
397,SP1,"I think the DMV called it like highway hypnosis or something like that I don't even know I don't even know why I still remember that
"
398,SP2,"That makes
"
399,SP2,"that makes sense that makes a lot of sense yeah I like don't understand how people Iike still don't have their licenses I literally got mine like the week after I turned sixteen
"
400,SP1,"Really
"
401,SP2,"well I didn't get my license I got my learner's permit like the week after I turned sixteen and then I took my road test when I was seventeen
"
402,SP1,"I think I got I got my permit um about when I was sixteen when when did I get my permit
"
403,SP2,"Yeah
"
404,SP1,"Yeah I got my permit like a decent amount of time after I was sixteen and I started taking lessons and then
"
405,SP1,"um When did I fini when did I pass my te
"
406,SP2,"You can you can take your uh you can get you license at sixteen in California
"
407,SP1,"Yeah
"
408,SP2,"Oh my god
"
409,SP1,"it really do be like that
"
410,SP2,"In New York it's like you can get your permit at sixteen and and then um
"
411,SP1,"Fifteen and a half in California
"
412,SP2,"oh my god
"
413,SP1,"It's nice
"
414,SP2,"that is insane
"
415,SP1,"I actually failed my permit test the first time
"
416,SP2,"That's insane
"
417,SP1,"Which is dumb cause it's the written test it's like so easy and I just bombed it
"
418,SP1,"the first time
"
419,SP2,"Oh my god yeah for us it's like when you're sixteen you can get your permit and then when you're seventeen you can take your road test but it's either like you have to have your permit for six months o
"
420,SP1,"Yeah I know it's
"
421,SP2,"Or you have to be seventeen
"
422,SP1,"Yeah
"
423,SP2,"And then you get your juniors license
"
424,SP1,"You have a junior's li
"
425,SP2,"But
"
426,SP1,"oh no there's the provisional license
"
427,SP2,"Yeah
"
428,SP1,"yeah
"
429,SP2,"so you get like your juniors license which is like you can drive alone to and from school and work everywhere else you have to have someone who is twenty one
"
430,SP1,"oh really
"
431,SP2,"Yeah
"
432,SP1,"Ours is li but the professional licenses uh I think you have to I think learner's permit is you have to drive with someone
"
433,SP2,"Yeah
"
434,SP1,"so that you can be that you could be doing that as soon as you're fifteen and a half
"
435,SP2,"mhm
"
436,SP1,"Then you have provisional license where I think you can't drive other people and you have to be you can't be driving between um eleven PM and six AM
"
437,SP2,"For New York it's five no
"
438,SP2,"Nine PM to five AM
"
439,SP2,"you can't you can't drive
"
440,SP1,"Nine
"
441,SP1,"That's harsh
"
442,SP2,"By yourself well you yeah you can drive but also like that's like just Long Island like New York City's so much more restrictive
"
443,SP1,"I I mean I can imagine
"
444,SP2,"Yeah
"
445,SP1,"it's crazy there
"
446,SP2,"and then like when you're eighteen you get your
"
447,SP1,"It's like mostly taxis
"
448,SP2,"Yeah you get your full license when you're eighteen or if you get your drivers license when you're seventeen but then you take driver's ed no okay wait if you take driver's ed and then take a road test you get your full license even if you're seventeen but I didn't take driver's ed cause like I would only have my juniors lessons for like three months and then like or like six months then I would get my full license so I'm like I can wait it out six months like I'm not gonna pay like four hundred dollars for it
"
449,SP2,"for drivers ed
"
450,SP1,"Yea
"
451,SP1,"yeah it's not really worth
"
452,SP2,"Yeah there's like so many stages and like I think what they're learner's permit like you have to be with a parent or a guardian you can drive within certain hours
"
453,SP1,"mhm
"
454,SP2,"and then junior's license you can only have like one other random person in the car um you have you can only drive alone to and from school and work and you have to everywhere else you have to have like an someone who's twenty one or over
"
455,SP1,"no
"
456,SP1,"driving just like having the the freedom to drive and like Junior year was like the nicest thing ever
"
457,SP2,"Yeah it was and like no one really like enforced the whole junior license thing so even if like
"
458,SP1,"If
"
459,SP1,"oh
"
460,SP2,"I would just drive alone everywhere like no one cause like it was just wasn't enforced but it was so nice like cause also we had like the senior privilege which is like during um you could just leave campus during your free periods
"
461,SP1,"Oh my gosh yeah off campus
"
462,SP2,"Yeah you get you can like go out for food

"
465,SP1,"Yeah
"
466,SP2,"and like It was so nice
"
467,SP1,"that's what we did all the time senior year

468,SP2,"just like driving to like Panera or something
"
469,SP1,"Yeah I know my friend would literally just like he'd like pile us on in his like little Chevy bowl and we'd all drive to like a burger place

"
482,SP2,"Yeah yeah that's true that's true like second semes second semester's just like whatever but first semester is actually really hard for me like it was just so much

531,SP1,"My friend was like one of the big editors on it and she even in second semester was like really stressed all the time
"
532,SP2,"Yeah I literally would like spend all my free time just like editing spreads
"
533,SP1,"Yeah
"
534,SP2,"and just like yeah
"
535,SP1,"I dropped Spanish second semester senior year and it was the best decision of my life

"
538,SP2,"so I didn't even take Spanish during my senior year
"
539,SP1,"Yeah I just made sure to take like the chillest classes in second semester
"
540,SP2,"mhm
"
541,SP1,"and it it was worth it
"
542,SP2,"oh my god Every other day I like every day I had like one lunch period but every other day I had like one class and then a free period two classes lunch two classes free period one class and then I'd go home so it was like I would do like very minimal work and then get like forty five minutes just chill and do nothing
"
543,SP1,"Oh my gosh
"
544,SP2,"Like every other like that was every other day and it was just so amazing
"
545,SP1,"Yeah there were like there was like one day I think it was honestly Fridays where we could just go off campus and because like most of us had a free period we'd just like stay off campus
"
546,SP1,"like There was this guy's apartment that we just went to and we would just like play video games up there for like straight up like two hours
"
547,SP2,"Yeah
"
548,SP2,"Yeah this girl I know she had like cause you have nine periods a day she like three four five six all free at the same time

551,SP1,"That sounds amazing
"
552,SP2,"and like just like she have like two hours to herself
"
553,SP1,"Yeah I would just like wait I would wake up late on like multiple days

"
555,SP2,"mm
"
556,SP2,"I had AP chem first period every day

"
560,SP2,"yeah eight AM AP chem and like the reason they have like very year it's always first periood just so like you can get it over with
"
561,SP1,"Yeah I I do like the idea of getting it over with
"
562,SP2,"cause like it's it's yeah like if it was ninth period I would absolutely die
"
563,SP1,"I would be dead at that point
"
564,SP2,"is Just too much
"
565,SP1,"That's just really rough
"
566,SP2,"cause like that class like kills your soul
"
567,SP1,"I'm so glad our schedule is like built in the in the way it is in college
"
568,SP2,"Yeah
"
569,SP1,"it's like
"
570,SP2,"like I like being in like control of my own time and being able to like choose when I do things

571,SP1,"mm
"
572,SP2,"and when I don't do things
"
573,SP1,"Yeah it's like I don't know on Tuesdays and Thursdays it's like kind of a rough day but I between my first class and my second class there's straight up three hours

"
579,SP2,"I wish like Mondays I start at one thirty
"
580,SP1,"Really
"
581,SP2,"Yeah
"
582,SP1,"I'd take like I'd take a nine thirty as opposed to a ten thirty if it meant I could sleep until one thirty on like Tuesdays or something
"
583,SP2,"Yeah it's it's nice cause like Monday's I start late and then Fridays I end early and like it's hard like waking up at nine thirty but like it's m it's not like eight thirty like it's manageable still
"
584,SP1,"Yeah if they're I I'm I made sure not to take any Friday classes and not to take any eight thirties
"
585,SP2,"Yeah I wasn't gonna take a Friday class but like it just happened I like my Spanish class was on a Friday which is fine cause like it's just nine thirty to ten twenty so like after that I'm fine
"
586,SP2,"and like
"
587,SP1,"And then you're free for the day
"
588,SP2,"Yeah like normally look on Fridays I would probably like wake up at ten thirty anyway so the fact that I'm done by ten twenty like it's it's so manageable
"
589,SP1,"I mean I w I sleep till noon on Fridays I don't know about you but
"
590,SP2,"I just I've already come back from Spanish and I get breakfast and then I go back to bed and then I wake up at like noon
