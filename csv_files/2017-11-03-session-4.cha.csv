"
SP1,"I m̲ 
"
SP2,"probably 
"
SP1,"I don't kno̲ 
"
SP2,"cause I ↑feel like more m 
"

"
SP2,"cause I feel like most intro classes are ⁎like m 
"
SP1,"yeah exactly that's why it's like really specific 
"
SP2,"so it's like kind of boring 
"
SP2,"s oh 
"
SP1,"I I'd like it's if it was general I think I would enjoy it mo̲re actually 
"
SP2,"oh 
"

"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Television 
"
SP1,"As long as I make through comp fifteen if I can't make it through then I have to like totally change everything 
"
SP2,"Oh my god 
"
SP1,"I don't know I don't cause comp fifteen I'm like worried cause after that you ta you take that you take like one hundred level course in comp sci and then like you don't have to take anymore for CBS 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"Comp sci they were just like the the hard like super hard comp sci class 
"
SP1,"Comp forty 
"
SP2,"Company as 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"You don't 
"
SP1,"and comp fifteen's supposed to be pretty hard so 
"
SP2,"Them are you to do with the come forty two or no no 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"That's good 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"It's good 
"
SP1,"And if I don't if I decide to like if I can't handle comp fifteen I could just minor and you don't need to take come fifteen 
"
SP2,"We should 
"
SP1,"huh 
"
SP2,"A what moment you wanna be a CVS major 
"
SP1,"um I mean I thought about psychology but then like I kind of wanted to like diversify you know 
"
SP1,"so 
"
SP1,"Yeah basically and comp sci's like pretty interesting I like it 
"
SP2,"Yes for interesting 
"
SP1,"And I'm thinking about like pre law stuff so 
"
SP2,"Pre law 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"There's in the pre law court 
"
SP2,"Now 
"
SP1,"There's like I took um 
"
SP2,"I mean just the perfect the the bar and everything on your own 
"
SP1,"Yeah and the LSAT yeah um I took sociology of law 
"
SP2,"O 
"
SP1,"And there's like a couple like random law classes there's like philosophy of law 
"
SP1,"And then like business law 
"
SP1,"And stuff 
"
SP2,"What a flaw 
"
SP1,"I haven't taken the like apparently like you don't really have to take law related stuff before you go to law school which is like kinda worrisome cause like I don't know if I really like it until I go to law school and like if I go to law school and I don't like it then like what do you do 
"
SP2,"That's true 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Lawyers 
"
SP1,"lawyers 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"Or 
"
SP1,"CBS is supposed to be a good like pre major if you're or major undergraduate majors if you're looking for law stuff 
"
SP2,"Wait why why is it so 
"
SP1,"cause just like psychology and then like you have to take logic and stuff 
"
SP2,"Oh 
"
SP1,"for CBS so 
"
SP2,"kay 
"
SP1,"or Like house of that 
"
SP1,"although I'm like 
"
SP1,"Debating about like the importance cause like law school like GPA and your LSAT score are like the number one most important things so like I'm not sure if I should like switch out of CBS to like an easier major so that I can have a high GPA cause there's like cause the apparently like law schools don't care like what's where what your what you did in undergrad as long as your grades are high 
"
SP1,"like there's like they they'd rather take like a four point oh in like film and media studies over like a three point four in like engineering or something 
"
SP2,"That's 
"
SP2,"That's odd why is that 
"
SP1,"cause like I mean I think it's just like the schools like want want the higher rankings from like their a their average GPA is high so they get more money you know 
"
SP2,"Why um 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP1,"it's like I'd say I think it's like I it's nice cause it's not as like subjective as like choosing a undergraduate college cause like it's just like pure like GPA and LSAT but like kinda sucks 
"
SP2,"That's true favor the easier hm 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP1,"What is med med school like what's the process I don't know anything I have like one Dr friend 
"
SP2,"Well 
"
SP1,"Do you know 
"
SP2,"Um I should probably should research into more of it I know that starting from next year should prepare for the 
"
SP2,"well I should take ish prepare like right I kinda like slight prepare right now for the MCAT 
"
SP2,"And then you you take the fucking test and then you apply it to a bunch of schools and hope you get in 
"
SP1,"yeah I mean I had like an existential crisis while I was studying comp for my exam I had an exam yesterday I was like instead of studying I was like looking up like law school statistics 
"
SP1,"and stuff like I was like what do I do with my life 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"No don't do that 
"
SP2,"yeah look up the stats for getting into med school I'm like yeah I'm scared 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP1,"U 
"
SP1,"Some rough careers 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"it's worrying 
"
SP2,"How you reckon it's been already 
"
SP1,"Oh yeah I don't even know what time is it 
"
SP2,"The walk here was really long 
"
SP1,"Yeah and I I went to the wrong place 
"
SP2,"Yes same I thought it'd be 
"
SP1,"In the psych building 
"
SP2,"Closer 
"
SP1,"But I guess the set up is in the thing 
"
SP2,"Yeah this is too legit 
"
SP1,"It's two forty two 
"
SP1,"So when did we get here you got here at like two twenty 
"
SP2,"mm 

"
SP1,"It's mostly like social I took social psych freshman year so like 
"
SP1,"I feel like I should know more 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"But I don't 
"
SP2,"I heard social psych was pretty fun actually 
"
SP1,"yeah it's really fun it's probably my favorite class that I've taken at Tufts 
