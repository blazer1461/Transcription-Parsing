"
106,SP1,"If it bounces twice
"
107,SP2,"So bounces twice okay
"
108,SP1,"Yeah so like imagine you're like playing tennis except like both sides of the cout are like mirrored on one side
"
109,SP2,"Mmmmm
"
110,SP1,"So like you hit the ball against the wall like imagine that's like going across the court and then it bounces off and then your opponent has to hit it back onto the wall
"
111,SP2,"When you hit it though you have to like step aside for your opponent to c
"
112,SP1,"Well yeah there's like enough room you do you don't want to hit it to yourself otherwise you'll get like point off
"
113,SP2,"Aye

114,SP2,"Do you that means you can also can you guys like add spins to your shots or like
"
115,SP1,"Yeah
"
116,SP2,"Okay
"
117,SP1,"I mean and you can hit it off the side walls and the back wall
"
118,SP1,"and like there's like ba lines to make sure which which parts the wall are out
"
119,SP2,"Oh okay that makes sense seven played okay
"

244,SP2,"Me neither linguistics or music theory
"
245,SP1,"linguistics I don't know anybody cause I don't go to class
"
246,SP1,"I mean it's it's like
"
247,SP1,"I say that stat like the stuff that we learn is like pretty like esoteric and like not useful but like linguistics is like on a whole nother level of useless
"
248,SP2,"It's
"
249,SP1,"and Like it's if you ever wanted to know what like the the bilabial valer like tract of your like tongue is then like take linguistics otherwise do not
"
250,SP2,"What what is that
"
251,SP1,"it's like it's in
"
252,SP2,"wait it's j̲ust the intro
"
253,SP1,"yeah
"
254,SP2,"okay o̲
"
255,SP1,"but like it's ∇w̲ay
"
256,SP2,"mm
"
257,SP1,"than I was expecting
"
258,SP2,"which if you like maybe if you went to like a h̲igher like level linguistics it'd be m it'd be more interesting
"
259,SP1,"I m̲
"
260,SP2,"probably
"
261,SP1,"I don't kno̲
"
262,SP2,"cause I feel like more m
"
263,SP1,"you have to build on those
"
264,SP2,"cause I feel like most intro classes are ⁎like m
"
265,SP1,"yeah exactly that's why it's like really specific
"
266,SP2,"so it's like kind of boring
"
267,SP2,"s oh
"
268,SP1,"I I'd like it's if it was general I think I would enjoy it mo̲re actually
"
269,SP2,"oh
"
270,SP1,"no
"
271,SP2,"nevermind then
"
272,SP1,"Yeah
"
273,SP1,"I mean it's required for CBS majors
"
274,SP2,"Yeah I my friends also CVS house comp sci eleven junior
"
275,SP1,"uh did I mention that I hate my life I hate my classes um it's like it's it's not bad honestly I I'm doing pretty well so
"
276,SP1,"it's just all the homeworks take forever
"
277,SP2,"Yeah I heard that too
"
278,SP1,"Yeah
"
279,SP2,"Television
"
280,SP1,"As long as I make through comp fifteen if I can't make it through then I have to like totally change everything
"
281,SP2,"Oh my god
"
282,SP1,"I don't know I don't cause comp fifteen I'm like worried cause after that you ta you take that you take like one hundred level course in comp sci and then like you don't have to take anymore for CBS
"
283,SP1,"yeah
"
284,SP2,"Comp sci they were just like the the hard like super hard comp sci class
"
285,SP1,"Comp forty
"
286,SP2,"Company as
"
287,SP1,"Yeah
"
288,SP2,"You don't
"
289,SP1,"and comp fifteen's supposed to be pretty hard so
"
290,SP2,"Them are you to do with the come forty two or no no
"
291,SP1,"Yeah
"
292,SP2,"That's good
"
293,SP1,"Yeah
"
294,SP2,"It's good
"
295,SP1,"And if I don't if I decide to like if I can't handle comp fifteen I could just minor and you don't need to take come fifteen
"
296,SP2,"We should
"
297,SP1,"huh
"
298,SP2,"A what moment you wanna be a CVS major
"
299,SP1,"um I mean I thought about psychology but then like I kind of wanted to like diversify you know
"
300,SP1,"so
"
301,SP1,"Yeah basically and comp sci's like pretty interesting I like it
"
302,SP2,"Yes for interesting
"
303,SP1,"And I'm thinking about like pre law stuff so
"
304,SP2,"Pre law
"
305,SP1,"yeah
"
306,SP2,"There's in the pre law court
"
307,SP2,"Now
"
308,SP1,"There's like I took um
"
309,SP2,"I mean just the perfect the the bar and everything on your own
"
310,SP1,"Yeah and the LSAT yeah um I took sociology of law
"
311,SP2,"O
"
312,SP1,"And there's like a couple like random law classes there's like philosophy of law
"
313,SP1,"And then like business law
"
314,SP1,"And stuff
"
315,SP2,"What a flaw
"
316,SP1,"I haven't taken the like apparently like you don't really have to take law related stuff before you go to law school which is like kinda worrisome cause like I don't know if I really like it until I go to law school and like if I go to law school and I don't like it then like what do you do
"
317,SP2,"That's true
"
318,SP1,"Yeah
"
319,SP2,"Lawyers
"
320,SP1,"lawyers
"
321,SP2,"Or
"
322,SP1,"CBS is supposed to be a good like pre major if you're or major undergraduate majors if you're looking for law stuff
"
323,SP2,"Wait why why is it so
"
324,SP1,"cause just like psychology and then like you have to take logic and stuff
"
325,SP2,"Oh
"
326,SP1,"for CBS so
"
327,SP2,"kay
"
328,SP1,"or Like house of that
"
329,SP1,"although I'm like
"
330,SP1,"Debating about like the importance cause like law school like GPA and your LSAT score are like the number one most important things so like I'm not sure if I should like switch out of CBS to like an easier major so that I can have a high GPA cause there's like cause the apparently like law schools don't care like what's where what your what you did in undergrad as long as your grades are high
"
331,SP1,"like there's like they they'd rather take like a four point oh in like film and media studies over like a three point four in like engineering or something
"
332,SP2,"That's
"
333,SP2,"That's odd why is that
"
334,SP1,"cause like I mean I think it's just like the schools like want want the higher rankings from like their a their average GPA is high so they get more money you know
"
335,SP2,"Why um
"
336,SP1,"yeah
"
337,SP1,"it's like I'd say I think it's like I it's nice cause it's not as like subjective as like choosing a undergraduate college cause like it's just like pure like GPA and LSAT but like kinda sucks
"
338,SP2,"That's true favor the easier hm
"
339,SP1,"yeah
"
340,SP1,"What is med med school like what's the process I don't know anything I have like one Dr friend
"
341,SP2,"Well
"
342,SP1,"Do you know
"
343,SP2,"Um I should probably should research into more of it I know that starting from next year should prepare for the
"
344,SP2,"well I should take ish prepare like right I kinda like slight prepare right now for the MCAT
"
345,SP2,"And then you you take the fucking test and then you apply it to a bunch of schools and hope you get in
"
346,SP1,"yeah I mean I had like an existential crisis while I was studying comp for my exam I had an exam yesterday I was like instead of studying I was like looking up like law school statistics
"
347,SP1,"and stuff like I was like what do I do with my life
"
348,SP2,"Yeah
"
349,SP2,"No don't do that
"
350,SP2,"yeah look up the stats for getting into med school I'm like yeah I'm scared
"
351,SP1,"yeah
"
352,SP1,"U
"
353,SP1,"Some rough careers
"
354,SP2,"Yeah
"
355,SP2,"it's worrying
"
356,SP2,"How you reckon it's been already
"
357,SP1,"Oh yeah I don't even know what time is it
"
358,SP2,"The walk here was really long
"
359,SP1,"Yeah and I I went to the wrong place
"
360,SP2,"Yes same I thought it'd be
"
361,SP1,"In the psych building
"
362,SP2,"Closer
"
363,SP1,"But I guess the set up is in the thing
"
364,SP2,"Yeah this is too legit
"
365,SP1,"It's two forty two
"
366,SP1,"So when did we get here you got here at like two twenty
"
367,SP2,"mm
"
368,SP1,"so like
"
369,SP2,"Its fair
"
370,SP1,"And like fifteen twenty minutes
"
371,SP1,"what an engaging conversation
"
372,SP2,"I know right totally
"
373,SP2,"wait w What's the purpose of u with them recording to us again I forgot
"
374,SP1,"They're like gonna analyze our like social uh cu
"
375,SP2,"Oh like our body language and what wedo
"
376,SP1,"Yeah
"
377,SP2,"Huh oh shit
"
378,SP1,"cause I don't think
"
379,SP1,"I mean I guess they are they don't they do care about the content of the conversation but
"
380,SP1,"It's mostly like social I took social psych freshman year so like
"
381,SP1,"I feel like I should know more
"
382,SP2,"Yeah
"
383,SP1,"But I don't
"
384,SP2,"I heard social psych was pretty fun actually
"
385,SP1,"yeah it's really fun it's probably my favorite class that I've taken at Tufts
"
386,SP1,"cause the professor was awesome
"
387,SP2,"Yeah my roommate said it was pretty awesome cause like uh didn't they have you take like in class like social experiments or something
"
388,SP1,"We did some yeah
"
389,SP2,"Yeah it sounds pretty fun
"
390,SP1,"But like the content was just really great in the textbook was fun to read also
"
391,SP2,"Nice
"
392,SP1,"yeah
"
393,SP1,"and it was like so easy and like so easy
"
394,SP2,"huh
"
395,SP1,"I didn't uh I mean I did go to class because it was fun honestly
"
396,SP1,"but like it's pretty easy
"
397,SP2,"that's pretty nice
"
398,SP1,"U
"
399,SP1,"Have you finished your like distribution requirements
"
400,SP2,"for just school or like
"
401,SP1,"Yeah just like school
"
402,SP1,"I mean have you finished like h h how far along are you
"
403,SP2,"What do we need English that's writing that's done
"
404,SP1,"Um yeah
"
405,SP2,"And then like
"
406,SP1,"and Then world civ
"
407,SP2,"What counts as a world civ again do culture classes count
"
408,SP1,"yeah
"
409,SP2,"I like get those I think I get those done like mm soon ish
"
410,SP2,"cause I think they also count for like towards your language right if you take like four courses of a language and then two courses of a culture
"
411,SP1,"Yeah I think I I mean I kinda screwed up cause I thought I would be jun done with Chinese last semester but like I I apparently they don't count like together I took Chinese cinema freshman year
"
412,SP2,"mhm
"
413,SP1,"and then Chinese one and two and I thought that was it cause I took French I'd passed out of three semesters of French so that would been six total semesters but like apparently you have to get to at least Chinese three before
"
414,SP1,"cause you need like three semesters of two languages to pass out
"
415,SP2,"O
"
416,SP1,"But then like now I can use the Chinese cinema as my world civ so I'm done with that
"
417,SP2,"but And then after world civ so this will natural sciences
"
418,SP2,"Which I
"
419,SP2,"probably don't need to worry about
"
420,SP1,"yeah
"
421,SP1,"Yeah
"
422,SP2,"cause I took like f
"
423,SP1,"yeah
"
424,SP1,"you're gonna take like fifty
"
425,SP1,"And then
"
426,SP1,"and like social sciences humanities and arts
"
427,SP2,"what counts as a social science again
"
428,SP2,"I don't remember
"
429,SP1,"it's like psychology sociology
"
430,SP2,"Oh yep that's definitely done soon
"
431,SP1,"yeah
"
432,SP2,"Arts
"
433,SP1,"And math there's math also
"
434,SP2,"oh fuck man that's sta don't z stats co̲unts as math
"
435,SP1,"I think this counts as m̲ath yeah
"
436,SP2,"yeah t this counts
"
437,SP1,"Well this I mean our the class that we're both in
"
438,SP2,"yeah
"
439,SP2,"Art classes
"
440,SP1,"oh
"
441,SP2,"Oh considering taking psychology of music I think it counts as both like a psych class
"
442,SP1,"Yeah I think I might take that next semester
"
443,SP2,"The it doesn't count as psych and as a art class
"
444,SP1,"I think so
"
445,SP2,"oh yeah
"
446,SP1,"And like I'm thinking about minoring in music
"
447,SP2,"minoring in Music
"
448,SP1,"like a very
"
449,SP2,"Music theory is there someone named is is there a curt in your class

451,SP2,"yeah Curt's pretty nice maybe he's
"
452,SP1,"The music theory is like
"
453,SP1,"Pretty fun right the professor is really cool but like if I didn't already like I just played piano for like ten years but
"
454,SP2,"For just like ten years
"
455,SP1,"yeah if I did
"
456,SP2,"that's that's a lot
"
457,SP1,"I did that if I hadn't done that I feel like I would have dropped it after the first week cause it's like pretty like hard to pick up
"
458,SP2,"wait playing piano counts as a hobby
"
459,SP1,"Yeah I know I totally forgot I had there just like coming to me

"
484,SP2,"just like stayed at this at a crap level

620,SP2,"That's true it's time consuming isn't like is thor supposed to die or something
"
621,SP1,"I think that's the rumor
"
622,SP1,"I mean like but it doesn't seem like the kind of vibe
"
623,SP2,"cause like
"
624,SP1,"Like the move like the trailers the stuff seems like very like guardians of the the galaxy kind of
"
625,SP2,"mm That's true
"
626,SP2,"cause I
"
627,SP1,"I like the story I think from the comics is that in ragnarok thor dies

"
639,SP1,"so
"
640,SP2,"okay
"
641,SP1,"yeah
"
642,SP1,"like we can either not like bad but like they're not like innovative
"
643,SP2,"mm
"
644,SP2,"that's true
"
645,SP1,"Like they used to be
"
646,SP2,"I mean at least they're not as bad as the DC movies

"
661,SP2,"How come
"
662,SP1,"Is like pretty boring it's just like a lot of it is like jump scares and like relying on like certain tricks to make sure
"
663,SP2,"That's true though I think I think it's based on like a novel like Stephen king's novel or something
"
664,SP1,"I heard it's good I mean I feel like if I watched it I'd probably enjoy it but like
"
665,SP1,"I wouldn't go out of my way
"
666,SP2,"it's like decent
"
667,SP2,"It like it's more of like a story with like a scary story so it's not like a shitty plot
"
668,SP1,"oh
"
669,SP2,"though I hate clowns though
"
670,SP2,"it makes me hate clowns even more
