"
SP2,"I have no fucking idea 
"
SP2,"And like 
"

"
SP1,"Is it an art credit 
"
SP2,"I don't think so 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"I wish it was all these people are like raising their hands and like oh it's like the difference between like this spectral reality and I'm like how did you get any of that like I don't know but it's I've always wanted to take a film class so 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"That is cool 
"
SP2,"I still might drop it cause it's so awk wait did I tell you how awkward and how much social anxiety I had when I was like trying to figure this out cause I like I literally emailed him like the professor and I was like Hey like I just added this class what do I need to do to catch up and also I may drop it like really soon because I'm not sure about like my other commitments yet 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"and so I like made u all the stuff whatever I came to the class and I like introduced myself to him after class which I was proud of myself for doing causeI never do stuff like that 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"I'm like so antisocial I was just gonna leave it but like I should just do this but h I like now it's even more awkward if I drop it because he like totally knows who am 

"
SP1,"why would you drop it 
"
SP2,"It's my fifth class and like 
"
SP1,"Oh because it's a fifth class 
"
SP2,"Depending on my other commitments or whatever and how cause literally the only reason I'm taking it's like for interest it's not like fulfilling anything for me I'm pretty sure it's not an art credit so 
"
SP1,"oh what else are you taking 
"
SP2,"all my classes are this is what wait did I tell you about my whole crisis that like maybe I'm stupid 
"
SP1,"no 

"
SP1,"No but you're in one that linguistics that you're like this is fairly hard 
"
SP2,"Yeah but like I feel like in general like people consider all the class that I take is like bullshit classes because they're like humanities or whatever 
"
SP1,"That means nothing 
"
SP2,"Anyway um 
"
SP1,"Most engineers might be able to take a humanities class and like most engineers say that a humanities class is actually really hard 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"

"
SP1,"that's fun 
"
SP2,"um but yeah what was I saying okay yeah nothingness creative writing 
"
SP2,"Now I'm in this film class stats and this linguistics 
