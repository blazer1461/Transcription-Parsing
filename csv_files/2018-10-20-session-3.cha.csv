3,SP2,"This is like this room's like set up like I literally feel like I'm being like interviewed
"
4,SP1,"Yeah
"
5,SP2,"When will CNN recognize me
"
6,SP1,"This is a news cast
"
7,SP2,"If I like had to um I think like I don't know I feel like in a d very dream world I would be an actor
"
8,SP1,"I don't I think like if I had talent in that aspect I would be an actor like
"
9,SP2,"I feel like my ultimate life goal would be in like a really like a well known movie franchise
"
10,SP1,"Yeah
"
11,SP2,"Like I don't know I feel like a life goal for me would to if I was an actor would be to be in the MCU or like Star Wars
"
12,SP1,"Like

"
20,SP1,"Yeah
"
21,SP2,"like I don't know it's they're like really recognizable people they're like very iconic but also
"
22,SP1,"mm
"
23,SP2,"I feel like the only problems like people think like oh you're just you're just like this character
"
24,SP1,"you're
"
25,SP1,"like Harry potter
"
26,SP2,"Yea
"
27,SP1,"Like Daniel Radcliffe can't get another job
"
28,SP1,"And honestly like I guess wait what's who's Hermione Granger
"
29,SP2,"Emma Watson
"
30,SP1,"Emma Watson has done a better job breaking out
"
31,SP2,"I know yeah
"
32,SP1,"But I feel like Daniel Radcliffe just gave up
"
33,SP2,"mm
"
34,SP1,"and started doing weird movies
"
35,SP2,"Maybe that's why
"
36,SP1,"And Broadway
"
37,SP2,"Or maybe he just enjoys doing that better
"
38,SP1,"Yeah maybe he does enjoy doing weird movies
"
39,SP2,"I don't know I feel like Emma Watson's more main stream
"
40,SP1,"Yeah she is
"
41,SP2,"Although I feel like it's easier for like female actors to like get
"
42,SP2,"More roles I guess
"
43,SP1,"Maybe
"
44,SP2,"I don't know
"
45,SP1,"Maybe it's because all female roles are so similar to each other
"
46,SP2,"That's true don't have to be that diverse
"
47,SP1,"Yeah
"
48,SP2,"What happened to Ron's actor like

"
96,SP2,"like I wonder like Like well they act what do they actually think about like being a Disney star
"

"
99,SP2,"mm
"
100,SP1,"especially so she did it with such at such a young age and with her dad was like super toxic for her and then I don't know I feel like she did it so well like she break out of the role so well
"
101,SP2,"mhm
"
102,SP1,"because she like she had the phaser everyone was like what are you doing

"
105,SP2,"I think they're talking really um like like the crazy stage was definitely like a marketing ploy like a publicity stunt
"
106,SP1,"Uhuh
"
107,SP2,"because like the whole point of it I think they said was like to like change her image from
"
108,SP1,"Yeah
"
109,SP2,"From like a child star to like being taken more seriously
"
110,SP1,"I think that so I definitely think there right

112,SP1,"The Disney conspiracies Hey

113,SP2,"I know
"
114,SP1,"Selena Gomez and have to but she wasn't as iconic as Hannah Montana

181,SP2,"like I hate crew G humor like
"
182,SP1,"I hate laugh tracks
"
183,SP2,"Like I I feel like a currency humor so much I'm just like I need to like get up and like Walker out to so I could like deal with this courage
"
184,SP1,"The second hand embarrassment
"
185,SP2,"I know
"
186,SP2,"It's like oh my god like how can you read the still
"

189,SP2,"mm
"
190,SP2,"Yeah like I always see them now it's like
"
191,SP1,"Yeah
"
192,SP2,"they're not that necessary
"
193,SP1,"Yeah
"
194,SP1,"I used to love the Big Bang theory and then I realize like how about it
"
195,SP2,"oh
"
196,SP2,"it's not I think that if you think about the purpose of the show that is not even like out great I guess
"
197,SP1,"Yeah
"
198,SP1,"and also like they pointed out a lot of problematic is about the characters like
"
199,SP2,"Yeah
"
200,SP1,"Like why is penny so stupid and
"
201,SP2,"Yeah
"
202,SP1,"Yeah
"
203,SP2,"I just like like I wonder like it what the Sheldon's actor feels about the role
"
204,SP1,"Yeah
"
205,SP2,"because it's like it's a very like I don't is like the most well known character out of all of them
"
206,SP1,"Yeah
"
207,SP2,"But like he's not exactly like
"
208,SP1,"I could
"
209,SP2,"In known like known like for
"
210,SP1,"Yeah
"
211,SP2,"For being a good character
"
212,SP1,"Yeah
"
213,SP1,"He's done like the act I really like the actor he's only other stuff like he was in the Muppets movie
"
214,SP2,"all
"
215,SP2,"what
"
216,SP1,"Of and then he's also playing like
"
217,SP1,"Uhm there's a show that's coming um not there's that movie that's coming out it's about
"
218,SP1,"Transmission standard kid
"
219,SP2,"mm
"
220,SP1,"and he plays a father
"
221,SP2,"So all
"
222,SP1,"Yeah
"
223,SP2,"This thing
"
224,SP1,"Yeah
"
225,SP2,"I don't know I feel to  although to be honest if you're like on a TV show that makes a lot of money I I would understand why people would not want it to like want to leave it
"
226,SP1,"Yeah yeah
"
227,SP2,"Because you have to ride the train as long as it makes money
"
228,SP1,"Ride the train
"
229,SP1,"True like
"
230,SP1,"But then you also have to like stop before you go down hill
"
231,SP2,"That's true I feel like you have to leave like at a good point like I heard awesome
"
232,SP2,"Like the lead character from the walking dead hit the actors leaving the show
"
233,SP1,"Which one
"
234,SP1,"oh the lead
"
235,SP2,"Here the lead character
"
236,SP1,"Oh um the one with the
"
237,SP2,"The beard yet yeah that guy
"
238,SP1,"Fair yeah
"
239,SP2,"Of
"
240,SP1,"Well he says he gonna get killed off so I was going to work
"
241,SP2,"I don't know um I don't know because it's like I feel like I mean like I I've heard the walking dead has gone really downhill
"
242,SP1,"Yeah
"
243,SP2,"Uhm for like I feel like because like every time like the actors like leave the show that they like kill the off
"
244,SP1,"Yeah
"
245,SP2,"I think that I think I've only seen one episode like one actual season of the walking dead season five
"
246,SP1,"mm
"
247,SP2,"but like the only character like I really liked when I watch it was um Stephen young's character
"
248,SP1,"Oh and rest in peace
"
249,SP2,"Yeah rest in peace
"
250,SP1,"I I just know that like
"
251,SP1,"Like they've gotten too crazy
"
252,SP2,"mhm
"
253,SP2,"I think it's just like
"
254,SP1,"And the premise
"
255,SP2,"I mean I guess there's not a lot you can do in the long run
"
256,SP1,"The thing is like a zombie like people living in the zombie apocalypse would not have survived for as long as a season
"
257,SP2,"Like I repressed it there's still that many people in like the issue human her hold
"
258,SP1,"yeah
"
259,SP1,"Yeah we have like a baby to or something
"
260,SP2,"I know they had a Beatles like that baby's gonna like die
"
261,SP1,"Yeah have you seen the quiet please
"
262,SP2,"No but I like know that the plot and roughly
"
263,SP1,"The Pharmacia
"
264,SP2,"Yeah
"
265,SP1,"They have like a baby like
"
266,SP2,"What the hell
"
267,SP1,"Tearing that link how
"
268,SP2,"Like honestly though like because like it's like the mother die s like how you're going to feed the baby that
"
269,SP1,"Oh true I don't think about that
"
270,SP2,"And also like babies are loud like how did those monsters like not kill a all the
"
271,SP1,"that's the thing
"
272,SP1,"That that is the
"
273,SP1,"As a problem in the movie
"
274,SP1,"Is like how do you keep the baby during this
"
275,SP2,"I e
"
276,SP2,"like a real all you did like when that when I felt when I heard they had like a baby carriages like how did this all these like not kill the baby like already
"
277,SP1,"Yeah
"
278,SP1,"because like yes so loud you have to like
"
279,SP1,"Carry it everywhere
"
280,SP2,"I know I know I feel like I'm like I feel like to be like close up of apocalyptic plots are like the most interesting because like I've always like
"
281,SP1,"mm
"
282,SP2,"all like how like societies gonna fall apart or like how people are gonna like recover
"
283,SP1,"that's so dark
"
284,SP2,"I know but I'm I feel like they usually make for like really good promises in like
"
285,SP1,"Like simulations kind of
"
286,SP2,"But yeah like movies are like video games
"
287,SP1,"mhm
"
288,SP2,"but like I feel like um
"
289,SP2,"Doesn't like Kerio like that I'm not for me I don't really like reading like reading about it
"
290,SP1,"Oh
"
291,SP2,"Like like it us in a book for
"
292,SP1,"Yeah
"
293,SP2,"But like I like group and I kind of look like see in person &la ughs just because like to see how it's all his realized
"
294,SP1,"Of like because there's a Lotta world building
"
295,SP2,"Yeah there is
"
296,SP1,"When it comes so that there's some good books that really did it well that I couldn't put down
"
297,SP1,"But yeah I tried reading have you heard of annihilation

301,SP1,"movie looks pretty good but I try to read the book and I was like I can't get pass
"
302,SP2,"What is it what is it about

303,SP1,"Uhm basically like the world is like it's like one of the I think it's one of those things where it's like all the city is a safe place
"
304,SP2,"mhm
"
305,SP1,"but like once you leave the city it's like there's a lot of stuff going on
"
306,SP2,"mhm
"
307,SP1,"but basically it's like
"
308,SP1,"It's almost like like weeds like these plants and stuff like
"
309,SP1,"All the organisms are like like altered and like weird and like distorted
"
310,SP2,"What
"
311,SP1,"Outside in the world so like they sent this woman like her husband gets sent out
"
312,SP2,"mhm
"
313,SP1,"to like research it and explore it but he like
"
314,SP1,"He like comes back like really different or something and so they think like it's not him it's actually like a copy of him that the outside world made
"
315,SP2,"oh
"
316,SP1,"Suit like they sent a bunch of like other researchers out or something
"
317,SP1,"And the yeah are you ever gonna watch it the end of the movie is really trippy

419,SP2,"I know
"
420,SP2,"Like some video on YouTube described it like it's like if an alien walk like if you show to alien and explained in el did alien like what movies are but like the alien tried to be cool Knowing a lot of movie act without like actually understanding like how the movie like it's like why movie can be like how a successful movie you operates it just like you ex lately go a movieneeds fought like characters it needs some plot it needs like
"
421,SP1,"And it's like this This like drama that happens here

423,SP2,"yeah
"
424,SP2,"it's like I don't know I like don't understand like that will be at all
"
425,SP1,"It's like I'm
"
426,SP1,"Putting in putting something into Google translate
"
427,SP2,"mhm
"
428,SP1,"taking the translated part and then putting it on the other side again so to translated again back into the original this is like not
"
429,SP2,"oh my god
"
430,SP2,"Yeah like whatever it whatever this is is like not like I don't even know
"
431,SP1,"But I heard like
"
432,SP1,"I heard like the guy who directed it was like this he had like a weir d backstory
"
433,SP2,"Yes No like
"
434,SP1,"Cuz like a model
"
435,SP2,"Him I don't know it's like Tommy was those like
"

"
437,SP2,"Like nobody knows like what we're he's from like

440,SP2,"He had funny in a because um V
"
441,SP1,"He had money he had a weird accent that
"
442,SP2,"Yeah
"
443,SP1,"No one really knows where it came from
"
444,SP2,"I know like thank
"
445,SP2,"It's like low key shady as hell
"
446,SP1,"Yeah but you know as an actor you probably do need he
"
447,SP2,"This is true
"
448,SP2,"I one I feel like those actors the rest of the actors are probably like I can't believe I've like
"
449,SP1,"That's
"
450,SP2,"participated for the I believe I I can't believe I participated in this
"
451,SP2,"Record RP Mike
"
452,SP1,"But they got it do it right like state
"
453,SP2,"I don't I mean I feel like
"
454,SP1,"Like the act is seriously
"
455,SP2,"The other actors weren't even like that but though
"
456,SP1,"Yeah because they were the people that can make it other roles
"
457,SP2,"Hello it's like like they're not good actors
"
458,SP1,"Yeah
"
459,SP2,"And the fact that they were in the room only made it made like later on worse I guess
"
460,SP1,"Have you seen the disaster artist
"
461,SP2,"No but it's like
"
462,SP1,"A good
"
463,SP2,"It's so slow to explain the backstory right
"
464,SP1,"Yeah it's like based on like
"
465,SP1,"The guy who is this friends who like coat did stuff with him um it's like based on his biography
"
466,SP2,"oh
"
467,SP1,"Yeah
"
468,SP2,"So I guess like
"
469,SP1,"If you I read about it
"
470,SP2,"Thanks I guess there's like some I mean obviously it like the Fred fall be like hit a bunch of stuff
"
471,SP1,"Yeah of
"
472,SP2,"For just like we don't like how the entire truth
"
473,SP1,"Yeah
"
474,SP1,"Still doesn't make sense even if we have to check
"
475,SP2,"That's true to be fair like a lot of directors make like interesting choices
"
476,SP1,"Yeah yeah
"
477,SP2,"Like Michael ray explosions
"
478,SP1,"That's just throwing money at the CG I had he
"
479,SP2,"Every fair though like the explosions to get a lot of at tention
"
480,SP1,"Yes say that because I know you like movies with lots of explosions
"
481,SP2,"I would like it easily or it you could like easily grab my attention I know I I think I just like movies are like not realistic
"
482,SP1,"Oh
"
483,SP2,"Like I just I like things that are not like set too much in the real world
"
484,SP1,"mm
"
485,SP2,"like I like I don't know I like MCU because it's like it's like in the real world but it's like not
"
486,SP1,"What do you like
"
487,SP2,"Like I I don't know I like I like things like MCU cause
"
488,SP1,"Which
"
489,SP2,"Like the mar
"
490,SP1,"What's MCU
"
491,SP2,"The Marvel cin the Marvel movies
"
492,SP1,"Oh oh yeah
"
493,SP2,"Because like they're like set you you know they're set in the real world but like obviously there's a lot of like fantasy sci fi elements to it
"
494,SP1,"mm
"
495,SP2,"so I guess like um that's why I like it
"
496,SP1,"mm
"
497,SP2,"um
"
498,SP2,"I know also I guess I just like things about
"
499,SP2,"That are not like common experiences
"
500,SP1,"Oh yeah like
"
501,SP1,"Like why would I watch movie that an average person get
"
502,SP2,"Yeah I know like to be on is like I can never really get like to be high and um like movies like
"
503,SP2,"Uhm like about like because like at like everyday people
"
504,SP1,"mhm
"
505,SP2,"I know like I don't I don't really like high school movies because it's kind of like this is it's like it's not realistic but it's it's but like it's supposed to be realistic so it's like I don't know like how to feel
"
506,SP1,"The I think a good enjoy enjoy like mean girls
"
507,SP2,"mhm
"
508,SP1,"because what they do is like the take kind of real things and they just exaggerated out of proportion
"
509,SP2,"I know
"
510,SP1,"It's like more rial I don't
"
511,SP2,"But I guess like those movies probably make more sense like are more like realistic
"
512,SP2,"If you like went to high school and like the early two thousand through the nineties
"
513,SP1,"Yeah
"
514,SP2,"Because the culture is like definitely change like in like the way bullying is for trade it's not like um we're gonna I'll
"
515,SP1,"I'll I'll
"
516,SP2,"He has not like we're going to like I don't know still your lunch money anymore it's like

520,SP2,"What I heard is a really good
"
521,SP1,"Wait you haven't seen it
"
522,SP2,"No
"
523,SP1,"You should definitely watch it like first well Asian lead
"
524,SP1,"Great and also like yeah I mean they portray high school kind of weird but it's like enjoyable because it's not real
"
525,SP1,"Yeah
"
526,SP2,"I think the main issues yes because the actors are so old they're not actual teenagers so they like
"
527,SP1,"The area
"
528,SP2,"So like when you see a like a high school movie it's always like but doctors are you like what twenty or something
"
529,SP1,"I'm like no high school junior senior looked This attracted
"
530,SP2,"You
"
531,SP2,"I know exactly
"
532,SP1,"Not at my school
"
533,SP2,"Like it my freshman look like literal children
"
534,SP1,"Yes the fresher look like children and the seniors look like
"
535,SP1,"Like men
