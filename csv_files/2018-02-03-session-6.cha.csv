"
480,SP1,"even this one I had trouble getting into

"
666,SP2,"How did he r oh if you're driving someone else's car you literally drive like five miles below the speed limit and like
"
667,SP1,"It was so funny yesterday we were talking
"
668,SP2,"was he in it alone
"
669,SP1,"Yeah
"
670,SP1,"Have you ever gotten in a crash

"
678,SP1,"were you texting you better not have been texting
"
679,SP2,"oh no
"
680,SP1,"good
"
681,SP2,"um
"
682,SP2,"It was I was going into my senior no I was going into my junior year
"
683,SP1,"mhm
"
684,SP2,"and I was driving my dad's car
"
685,SP1,"mhm
"
686,SP2,"I'll forget and I was in Bedford New Bedford New Hampshire
"
687,SP1,"mhm
"
688,SP2,"and at my I knew my two friends I lived really close to each other I like thought I knew the way because I was driving from one graduation party to the other and I took a wrong turn and I thought it we were literally like in the middle of nowhere like I was convinced that we were in like a neighborhood area and then I think what's it called
"
689,SP2,"New Boston road where the speed limits like fifty but people drive sixty and at the stop sign was literally in the woods and I missed it and I just like went into like oncoming traffic and I hit someone's back en and then he spun out but like in they literally though like I
"
690,SP2,"Had nothing like I literally never saw the other car so I went to a four hour practice the next day like I didn't even feel sore cause I never saw that car but I completely totaled like totaled my dad's car a
"
691,SP1,"Wait I'm so confused what Wait what is having being sore have to do with it
"
692,SP2,"Because usually when you get car accidents like you subconsciously get like tense even if like it like happens like this like your body just like naturally like whatever but like s I had s that like s is how genuinely I never saw the other car and like
"
693,SP2,"It was wild
"
694,SP1,"Oh was the guy okay
"
695,SP2,"Yeah he was a he was fine I I think he I'm not really sure it was such a blur I thought I killed him I was crying I had nightmares for months after it
"
696,SP2,"Um well it was the first car accident in the past decade that no one died so that was scary
"
697,SP1,"What do you mean
"
698,SP2,"Because people go sixty on it
"
699,SP1,"Oh the first ticket on that I mean the first accident on that road
"
700,SP2,"And that intersection
"
701,SP2,"well that intersection specifically because that st I don't know what's wrong with that intersection
"
702,SP1,"Why don't they just fix the intersection so people stop crashing
"
703,SP2,"I don't know but so I didn't even get a ticket I like cause they're just like yeah
"
704,SP1,"saSo happy that everyone w fine
"
705,SP2,"well that and then also just like it's a really bad intersection and what else well like worst case scenario well there are two things that could have happened one is I pulled out an oncoming car could have come
"
706,SP1,"Yeah I've heard of that happening
"
707,SP2,"and like hit me in the door
"
708,SP2,"that would've been t that would've been
"
709,SP1,"Especially if the car came onto your driver's side
"
710,SP2,"No right cause like it was like this like this his road oncoming me
"
711,SP1,"hm
"
712,SP2,"so if I pulled out like
"
713,SP1,"Then the people would have come
"
714,SP2,"Boom I would have died and then also if it was like half a second sooner I would have hit him in his door but I was going like twenty five miles an hour like I was not going remotely fast I was also lost so I was driving really slow and then if I had also gone half a second later I would have completely cleared the intersection so then it's just like one of those like things and I would just always been like oh my god like thats so scary and like never talk about it ever again but
"
715,SP2,"yeah
"
716,SP1,"Well that's scary
"
