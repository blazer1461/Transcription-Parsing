"
SP1,"Like why do we 
"
SP1,"like adhere to these like societal norms like why are we nice to people why like was what's the point because we're just gonna 
"
SP2,"Well that's my question we're we're just animals like what like why am I 
"
SP1,"Like why do I feel the need to like what does it matter if I like am nice to somebody 
"
SP2,"Exactly and like there's like I I don't I guess I don't real ly know 
"
SP1,"but I am like I have to be 
"

"
SP2,"Someone who like 
"

"
SP1,"I played so much I played so much Tetris growing up 
"

"
SP2,"Like if it was something that we knew I knew happened in the film like I wasn't sure if it happened in the audio too I just 
"
SP2,"Had to say I didn't know 
"
SP2,"And the like after that we had to like answer questions about the differences between the film and the audio 
"
SP2,"And it took like an hour and a half and it was just like so stupid and then like I found out I was the control so like m that's why it was so stupid like and like the actual ones like they see how you do like under stress or whatever so like 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"It's um like 
"
