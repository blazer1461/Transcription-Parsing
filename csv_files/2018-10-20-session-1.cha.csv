"
242,SP2,"Yeah No that's definitely going to be a part
"
243,SP1,"How do they social interact
"
244,SP2,"and then it's going to be like talking about like how the conversation kind of like lulled for a sec when you went on your phone
"
245,SP1,"but No
"
246,SP2,"but no Picking it right back up
"
247,SP1,"but it's not gonna lull
"
248,SP1,"greatest fear
"
249,SP2,"my greatest fear
"
250,SP2,"real talk
"
251,SP1,"yeah
"
252,SP2,"Like the fact that like we have no control over anything ever and like we can like
"
253,SP2,"like we can like say like oh like I care about this so much like oh this is so important but like at the end of the day we're all just gonna be like a speck of nothingness on the entire line of human existence and human existence itself is probably gonna be a tiny little
"
254,SP2,"spot on the entire universe which what the fuck is the universe we can s̲pend our days praying to a god and even if that god's real doesn't fucking matter ccause we're all just gonna die anyway
"
255,SP1,"whoa I would say mine is
"
256,SP2,"so yeah that's my greatest fear
"
257,SP1,"I think
"
258,SP2,"and throwing up
"
259,SP1,"You're like that and bears
"
260,SP2,"I gotta knock on wood a desk gotta knock on wood
"
261,SP1,"so you don't throw up
"
262,SP2,"ye b̲ears
"
263,SP1,"no I was joking
"
264,SP2,"oh
"
265,SP1,"Um it's a
"
266,SP1,"Not really a fear but like that does kind of freak me out like
"
267,SP2,"It's so trippy
"
268,SP1,"yeah like
"
269,SP2,"like
"
270,SP1,"Well why do we like
"
271,SP2,"like what's the fucking point
"
272,SP1,"Like why do we
"
273,SP1,"like adhere to these like societal norms like why are we nice to people why like was what's the point because we're just gonna
"
274,SP2,"Well that's my question we're we're just animals like what like why am I
"
275,SP1,"Like why do I feel the need to like what does it matter if I like am nice to somebody
"
276,SP2,"Exactly and like there's like I I don't I guess I don't real ly know
"
277,SP1,"but I am like I have to be
"
278,SP2,"what like a sociopath really is but like when you think a like a sociopath that's like
"
279,SP2,"Someone who like
"
280,SP1,"just a normal thing like that shit you know like
"
281,SP2,"It's just like someone someone who's like a sociopath just like
"
282,SP2,"Doesn't like have like empathy or whatever but like
"
283,SP1,"yeah
"
284,SP2,"We don't like foster empathy completely ever like aren't we all little bit sociopathic like you can say like oh like I feel bad but like
"
285,SP2,"It's like
"
286,SP2,"Yeah yeah we we're h we're here having a deep conversation about like the universe and fucking
"
287,SP1,"sorry but um but whatevs
"
288,SP2,"it's okay I'll get over it
"
289,SP1,"you're gonna hear it blows nose mm nice
"
290,SP2,"there we go oh shit
"
291,SP1,"um
"
292,SP1,"it's like the
"
293,SP1,"Something else I find interesting is like why do we
"
294,SP1,"Isn't it weird that when you're born you're immediately like in
"
295,SP1,"Like how you the government can just send you to prison like you never agreed to be part of the society does that make sense
"
296,SP2,"Yeah
"
297,SP2,"they like well
"
298,SP1,"You're like forced to be in
"
299,SP2,"There's this whole like idea of like the social contract and like the consent of the governed but literally like by being born for eighteen years you have like
"
300,SP2,"No consent
"
301,SP1,"There's no way to just live free like truly
"
302,SP2,"But like would we want to is the thing
"
303,SP1,"Oh no
"
304,SP1,"I don't t hink so but I just think it's f Like
"
305,SP2,"Like
"
306,SP1,"like It's crazy to think about
"
307,SP2,"And it's really weird to think that there's like really not that much that separates us from
"
308,SP2,"Any other animal so why do we think we're so much like different
"
309,SP1,"cause we got the brains
"
310,SP2,"well but that's my thing like why do we think that everything animals do is just like animalistic and purely evolutionary but then everything we do is somehow different
"
311,SP1,"yeah
"
312,SP2,"Like I don't wanna say like everything in like psychology and shit can be explained by like the like evolutionary like
"
313,SP1,"Yeah
"
314,SP2,"View point but like
"
315,SP1,"Yeah
"
316,SP2,"e I don't know I'm just in intro to psych
"
317,SP2,"what do I know
"
318,SP1,"true
"
319,SP1,"true
"
320,SP2,"just ask Lis Lisa
"
321,SP1,"yeah we should get Lisa in here
"
322,SP2,"we should get
"
323,SP2,"Lisa
"
324,SP1,"what if Lisa sees this footage because she's a researcher

333,SP1,"And I some some days I need Sam
"
334,SP2,"Some days I need Sam

335,SP1,"honest
"
336,SP2,"somedays I need a little little joke like

337,SP1,"Yeah no and like Lisa does joke

338,SP2,"Lisa definitely does

339,SP1,"and she shows great video clips
"
340,SP2,"great Videos
"
341,SP1,"Honestly both of them do
"
342,SP2,"Both of them do
"
343,SP1,"I think they both make the slides
"
344,SP2,"yeah they might do it together that's really great collaboration
"
345,SP1,"I think they know how to break it up
"
346,SP2,"on their part
"
347,SP1,"by giving us like clips
"
348,SP2,"I I completely agree
"
349,SP1,"And also it is helpful like it it's a good example
"
350,SP2,"I was fucking dying laughing in class the other day it was
"
351,SP2,"Somers mike fell
"
352,SP1,"oh yeah
"
353,SP2,"and he was just like
"
354,SP1,"oo
"
355,SP1,"yeah

360,SP2,"Molly dot oh shit did I put the dot
"
361,SP2,"I don't know if I wrote my email correctly on the form

362,SP1,"it's probably okay
"
363,SP1,"bu
"
364,SP1,"This equipment is so high teck
"
365,SP2,"It really is like I feel like like like this is definitely much more legit than the one of the other ones I went to
"
366,SP1,"what
"
367,SP2,"it was so dumb
"
368,SP1,"which one did you do
"
369,SP2,"so I did this one
"
370,SP2,"And basically so we had to watch a silent film
"
371,SP2,"And then we had to listen to an audio that described the silent film but they weren't like exactly the same
"
372,SP2,"then I had to play Tetris for awhile which it was my first time ever playing Tetris can you believe that
"
373,SP1,"I played so much I played so much Tetris growing up
"
374,SP2,"I was nineteen and I had never played Tetris
"
375,SP2,"Anyway and then I had to like answer questions but the questions could only be based on the audio
"
376,SP2,"Like if it was something that we knew I knew happened in the film like I wasn't sure if it happened in the audio too I just
"
377,SP2,"Had to say I didn't know
"
378,SP2,"And the like after that we had to like answer questions about the differences between the film and the audio
"
379,SP2,"And it took like an hour and a half and it was just like so stupid and then like I found out I was the control so like m that's why it was so stupid like and like the actual ones like they see how you do like under stress or whatever so like
"
380,SP1,"yeah
"
381,SP2,"It's um like
"
382,SP2,"like you you could do it like like one thing that they did was like they put your hand in ice water
"
383,SP1,"oh
"
384,SP2,"Which
"
385,SP2,"That would be kinda stressful to me I don't like that
"
386,SP1,"Yeah I'm I'm usually the control
"
387,SP1,"like I've always like
"
388,SP2,"I've only ever been the control
"
389,SP1,"Yeah I'm always like wow this is dumb and then I'm like oh it' s because normally they there's like a point to it
"
390,SP2,"Yeah this s th s a change
"

"
493,SP2,"and so
"
494,SP2,"I like put that on my story and he like slid up on it and he was like I survived a tornado once I was like what I was like what you talking about like why are you even like saying this and and he was like well l you're saying you believe survivors so I'm telling you my stories I go like this isn't like funny this isn't like something to joke about he's like wait no like I seriously don't get it and I was like this I'm speaking about sexual assault and rape like how we believe females when they tell their stories and males too

"
500,SP1,"yeah
"
501,SP2,"It doesn't really affect him
"
502,SP1,"It doesn't affect him

"
506,SP1,"that's wild
"
507,SP1,"mm

510,SP2,"but yeah
"
511,SP1,"Is she like
"
512,SP1,"Not liberal or whatever
"
513,SP2,"She's registered as a Republican
"
514,SP1,"But like socially
"
515,SP2,"but like
"
516,SP2,"so yeah she's like socially liberal but that's like kind of I kind of have a problem with people who are like just socially liberal cause like
"
517,SP2,"In the US like nothing's going to change without money and like
"
518,SP2,"A lot of the times
"
519,SP2,"They play into each other like people of color are not just oppressed socially they're opressed like financially
"
520,SP1,"Yeah
"
521,SP2,"Because of a lot of the social obstacles in place and so like for someone to be like
"
522,SP2,"Socially liberal but still like wicked fiscally conservative just kinda like shows like
"
523,SP1,"yeah
"
524,SP2,"You
"
525,SP2,"Like it's like you're aware that you have privilege and you're like oh that kinda sucks but you don't really want to change it
"
526,SP1,"Yeah
"
527,SP2,"Like
"
528,SP1,"makes sense
"
529,SP2,"you know what I'm saying like so that just like kinda rubs me the wrong way but like she's super like open and accepting I mean I haven't really asked if she's like fiscally conservative I just know  I remember she mentioned she  registered Republican and
"
530,SP2,"She but she also has told me that she is like like social issues a very accepting stuff like that so I don't know that I don't know
"
531,SP1,"didn't she put on her um
"
532,SP1,"like roommate thing
"
533,SP2,"two point five
"
534,SP1,"out of ten
