95,SP2,"mm
"
96,SP1,"I don't know
"
97,SP1,"I like I'm debating if I wanna do a show or a movie
"
98,SP2,"I think that like
"
99,SP2,"I don't like I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to find a specific episode in
"
100,SP1,"like within the show
"
101,SP2,"Within the season
"
102,SP1,"mhm
"
103,SP2,"because like if I've I feel like if I focus on the whole season it's
"
104,SP1,"yeah
"
105,SP1,"Yeah yeah she said you're allowed to like look at it as a whole
"
106,SP2,"Yeah yeah so I was I was thinking of doing that
"
107,SP1,"mhm
"
108,SP1,"Yeah I was like debating and you have ever heard of like on my block
"
109,SP2,"I heard of it
"
110,SP1,"Yeah
"
111,SP2,"They casted like this like white girl to play like
"
112,SP1,"Yeah it was like weird yeah
"
113,SP2,"a Mex she didn't even how to speak Spanish
"
114,SP1,"Yeah
"
115,SP2,"and like
"
116,SP1,"it was weird but like the show itself the writing was good the acting was eh but like it was interesting maybe I'll do that
"
117,SP2,"What was it about
"
118,SP1,"It's like it's just about like these kids living I think in LA and just like their lives and experiences
"
119,SP2,"mm
"
120,SP1,"I don't know it was It was entertaining like I enjoyed watching it
"
121,SP2,"Yeah
"
122,SP1,"But I'm so conflicted cause I wanna do dear white people but I feel like
"
123,SP1,"it's too like there's not enough critics criticism but I could do there
"
124,SP1,"ya know
"
125,SP2,"I get that
"
126,SP1,"Like it's very purposely a good representation
"
127,SP2,"very purpose
"
128,SP1,"Yeah
"
129,SP2,"Yeah
"
130,SP1,"like
"

"
133,SP2,"Yeah
"
134,SP2,"Yeah
"
135,SP1,"so I'm like trying to think maybe if I could
"
136,SP2,"Yeah
"
137,SP1,"Pick something so I could be more critical
"
138,SP2,"Yeah that's a good thing about like coven is that they touch on like they inadvertently touch on it cause obviously cause it's like oh witches and like that's not real but like they still touch on that divide
"
139,SP1,"mhm
"
140,SP2,"and it's very evident
"
141,SP2,"and like they do
"
142,SP2,"To a certain extent do a good job
"
143,SP1,"mhm
"
144,SP2,"you know like it I think r really do emph like  over emphasize on some things like the fact that like she owns a hair braiding
"
145,SP1,"mm
"
146,SP2,"like salon in like twenty sixteen whenever the show whenever the season came out
"
147,SP1,"Yeah

148,SP2,"you know like and I guess I don't know
"
149,SP1,"mhm

"
151,SP1,"honestly I might just do Brooklyn nine nine
"
152,SP2,"You know
"
153,SP1,"Like even though she used it as an example I just think it could be like really interesting
"
154,SP2,"Jake Peralta character I know like we have the same initials and everything but like he's kind of annoying I saw the first episode and like
"
155,SP1,"Yeah I know he he gets better
"
156,SP2,"Yeah it's like the new girl my gosh she's so annoying too
"
157,SP1,"Yeah but she he's not annoying in the same way that she's like he he's not annoying once you get used to him
"
158,SP1,"she's always annoying
"
159,SP2,"Yeah
"
160,SP2,"she's always annoying
"
161,SP1,"she just like constantly annoy
"
162,SP2,"the way she talks with like her big eyes
"
163,SP1,"Yeah but actually that gets less bad throughout the seasons but she's still annoying like you don't realize how annoying she used to be cause she's still annoying all the way through but when you rewatch you're like oh my god she was so annoying
"
164,SP2,"She was so annoying
"
165,SP2,"you just you just become accustomed to her
"
166,SP1,"Like
"
167,SP1,"Yeah like I still find her annoying even in like the last season but like the first she's like a whole different like level of annoying there
"
168,SP2,"Really
"
169,SP2,"Really
"
170,SP1,"Yes she comes like bearable but like first season she was like beyond
"
171,SP2,"No Way
"
172,SP1,"mm
"
173,SP2,"This is so weird cause I feel like it's a mirror but it's not

175,SP2,"Right isn't kinda like offputting
"
176,SP1,"Yeah

492,SP2,"Yeah
"
493,SP1,"Your relatives
"
494,SP2,"That's so interesting
"
495,SP1,"Yeah but I mean you can do it like very specifically
"
496,SP2,"so your dad was Jewish is Jewish
"
497,SP1,"mhm
"
498,SP2,"so your mom had to convert

"
504,SP1,"there's actually like a decent
"
505,SP2,"oh I didn't know that
"
506,SP1,"Decent Jewish population in Argentina cause a lot of
"
507,SP2,"I didn't know that
"
508,SP1,"Jews fled Eastern Europe to Argentina in the late eighteen hundreds
"
509,SP2,"That's like a pretty far
"
510,SP1,"Yeah it's a weird also Argentina's also connected with a lot of Nazis fled there
"
511,SP1,"uh huh
"
512,SP2,"After the war
"
513,SP1,"After World War two a lot of Nazis fled to
"
514,SP1,"Argentina
"
515,SP2,"that why they ha that's why they have those rooted like very prejudiced views on certain things
"
516,SP1,"Yeah
"
517,SP1,"Yeah which is interesting because like my family went to Argentina in the late eighteen hundreds so
"
518,SP2,"Just I yeah I was talking about Argentina like certain Arg Argentine people
"
519,SP1,"oh yeah it's very like
"
520,SP2,"and like just the way they yeah it's
"
521,SP1,"Europeanized
"
522,SP2,"Yeah and they have certain like prejudices
"
523,SP1,"mhm
"
524,SP1,"Yeah they do
"
525,SP2,"Which is really interesting
"
526,SP1,"Yeah I was reading an article how like it's gotten less prejudiced
"
527,SP2,"maybe we're like the rest of Latin America
"
528,SP1,"Yeah
"
529,SP2,"It is very white
"
530,SP2,"right
"
531,SP1,"it is
"
532,SP1,"yeah
"
533,SP2,"Is has a very small population of like
"
534,SP1,"Yeah
"
535,SP2,"People of color
"
536,SP1,"Yeah a lot of it is just like Very mixed
"
537,SP2,"I haven't met an origin
"
538,SP1,"like very diluted
"
539,SP2,"diluted
"
540,SP1,"Like if you look at the soccer team
"
541,SP2,"mm
"
542,SP1,"Obviously I do um like I would say like at least a good handful of them like look like they have indigenous roots
"
543,SP2,"Oh indigenous roots
"
544,SP1,"mhm
"
545,SP2,"um
"
546,SP1,"Yeah
"
547,SP1,"but like if you look at Messi like no but like some of the other ones like really do look like
"
548,SP1,"That
"
549,SP2,"Native
"
550,SP1,"Yeah native
"
551,SP2,"native so like yeah that makes sense
"
552,SP1,"Yeah so it's a lot like  I think like the government is super white and they perpetuate like the whiteness
"
553,SP2,"oh a one hundred percent
"
554,SP1,"So like there actually is like a decent population of indigenous people and like mixed people but they get like obscured by the government and are kind of like left out of it
"
555,SP2,"When do the indigenous people not get ups like where
"
556,SP1,"No true
"
557,SP2,"like
"
558,SP1,"yeah they're just like not as visible so people like perceive it as like is the super white country
"
559,SP2,"Yeah
"
560,SP2,"yeah
"
561,SP1,"which like it is but also has a significant non white population that's just kind of hidden
"
562,SP2,"mhm
"
563,SP1,"Because they want to present this image as like the Europeanized Latin American country
"
564,SP2,"Yeah
"
565,SP2,"that's wild
"
566,SP1,"Yeah
"
567,SP2,"I really didn't know much about Argentina until like I made friends with like
"
568,SP1,"Yeah
"
569,SP2,"like my Italian friend
"
570,SP1,"Yeah it's really interesting
"
571,SP2,"mhm
"
572,SP1,"I also don't know all of it because
"
573,SP2,"Yeah I mean
"
574,SP1,"Like my mom has told me a lot of stuff but I still know
"
575,SP2,"mm
"
576,SP1,"like no don't talk about it here I don't want them to get scared
"
577,SP2,"wow
"
578,SP1,"that they haven't told me even though they've told me a lot
"
579,SP1,"So
"
580,SP2,"That's wild
"
581,SP1,"Yeah I want to learn more about it
"
582,SP2,"Yeah even when I like when I s like said on talk to them about like why we left Tiar
"
583,SP1,"mhm
"
584,SP2,"like it
"
585,SP2,"Yeah like there's so many stuff there's so much stuff that when I was like younger I guess like
"
586,SP1,"Yeah
"
587,SP2,"I like just didn't know
"
588,SP1,"Yeah
"
589,SP2,"You know
"
590,SP1,"Yeah
"
591,SP2,"And like when we sat down and like she told me like like a lot of like the whole story basically like
"
592,SP1,"mhm
"
593,SP2,"a lot of things made sense a lot of s things still like didn't
"
594,SP1,"mhm
"
595,SP2,"but in the way I just like if like there's like some clarity to everything
"
596,SP1,"yeah like I when I was younger they just
"
597,SP2,"There's like a purpose No Way
"
598,SP1,"Yeah they just hold it let us like um we left for like economic opportunity and like that was like the story we heard
"
599,SP2,"Very generic like American dream yeah
"
600,SP1,"that
"
601,SP1,"Yeah as I got older since like on a military dictatorship
"
602,SP2,"Easter Easter via

603,SP1,"that's what
"
604,SP1,"And like everyone was disappearing
"
605,SP2,"Yeah
"
606,SP2,"Yeah
"
607,SP1,"That's why
"
608,SP2,"Yeah
"
609,SP1,"So like I don't know as I've gotten older I've learned more about like what happened
"
610,SP2,"Yeah
"
611,SP2,"I didn't does your mom still have family in Argentina
"
612,SP1,"Yeah we still have not immediate family but like cousins and like family friends and like
"
613,SP2,"mm
"
614,SP1,"people that are just like considered family even if they're not like my grandparents like never wanted to come here and don't like it they don't not like it here but they like didn't want to assimilate are not
"
615,SP1,"they were like miss being there

621,SP1,"on
"
622,SP2,"Any part of like Latin America's so expensive

"
624,SP1,"The like they didn't like just like the culture here and the atmosphere is it's very cold
"
625,SP2,"I mean
"
626,SP1,"so they like

628,SP1,"Their friends are still there and like they still talk to them all the time
"
629,SP2,"mhm
