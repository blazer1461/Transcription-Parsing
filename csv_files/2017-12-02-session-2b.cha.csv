"
91,SP2,"Did they do an xray and stuff
"
92,SP1,"u
"
93,SP1,"there's like oh like the n say keep elevated like ice and stuff like that like and how to do that f or a week for forty go back health services for that week I didn't do anyt hing mechanical where can like it was pouring because like I ha d to do with all I did was like lay in bed and just like sleep for a long time i n the wake up and can do anything again and like
"
94,SP2,"Yeah
"
95,SP1,"Felt so needed to because like my roommate like head start working either as like I have for like order food
"
96,SP1,"He'd have to go to get it for me because I can like walk all the way down yeah in the end like what it was like the didn't figure out what it w as either I'm
"
97,SP1,"They thought it was a was it
"
98,SP1,"Like the health services doctor thought that it was like tendonitis or something
"
99,SP2,"oh
"
100,SP1,"like along the right side of my foot um  but then when I started doing um what's it called
"
101,SP1,"not
"
102,SP1,"um
"
103,SP1,"Not therapy it's like
"
104,SP2,"Physical ther Physical therapy
"
105,SP1,"Yeah physical therapy yeah yeah
"
106,SP1,"And when I had to start doing like PT like that's when like the guy was like yeah he's like I'm pretty sure like you had like a stress fracture or like something like that
"
107,SP2,"Oh
"
108,SP1,"Yeah it's like that was I did that for like basically like the rest of the summer and like couldn't go running at all and like
"
109,SP2,"oh
"
110,SP1,"do anything that like I wanted to do
"
111,SP1,"Which sodium and then I had like been running at all for a whil e the first time actually ran was the day before thanksgiving
"
112,SP2,"oh wow
"
113,SP1,"and like
"
114,SP1,"I feel okay
"
115,SP2,"Is it fine now
"
116,SP1,"I think yeah it's definitely got a better look over like the past few months I think like at the beginning of school like I can like public if I stood on it for like normal stance for too long to like like puts like the too much pressure like that it was like stepping like
"
117,SP1,"Not hurting but just like uncomfortable and so that's when it at but Schif rin pressurelike I think like now it's like almost normalize to like the point were like I think it if I had like Stanford along how club I'm in the choirs like sometimes were like skinny too long like that's when the guilt feel like little bit discomfort but yeah I think everything's like better
"
118,SP2,"mhm
"
119,SP1,"but I think it's like like getting injured I think during the school year it's just so much wears
"
120,SP2,"yeah h
"
121,SP1,"I heard a story about a guy who's on the football team I think and then at the homecoming game he got hu rt
"
122,SP2,"Oh
"
123,SP1,"And then he broke his leg or something happened but then h ere take like a semester off because like the school is in like handicap a ccessible look at all really
"
124,SP2,"Yeah
"
125,SP1,"Because like every take all hill
"
126,SP2,"Yeah
"
127,SP1,"And like those few places that have like ramps for the glitches and stuff like that
"
128,SP2,"Right yeah
"
129,SP1,"F
"
130,SP2,"Yeah I mean I kind of though okay because the timing of the surgery was meant that like I had the thanksgiving days off
"
131,SP1,"Yeah
"
132,SP2,"and then and weekend
"
133,SP2,"um
"
134,SP2,"and then I took Monday off and then like I want to I came for clas ses on Tuesday um but I moved back to campus on Wednesday because I was s taying at a friend's apartment like I my parents came
"
135,SP1,"mm
"
136,SP1,"mm
"
137,SP2,"to like help with everything
"
138,SP2,"But like F if I had to have the surgery like a different time I would like I would have to miss when will cost spend harder
"
139,SP2,"like if it's good because
"
140,SP1,"Yeah
"
141,SP2,"Like the surgery that I got out means I can still kind of like walk just it takes longer
"
142,SP1,"Yeah
"
143,SP2,"But like there was an option for different surgery wher e they would of reattached the piece of cartilage that fell off
"
144,SP1,"oo
"
145,SP2,"um
"
146,SP2,"and like and they were like the place my like I'm instead of just typ ing it up
"
147,SP2,"And so that would have been like a more major surgery like I woul d've been in more pain so in the in like that case I would miss like so much more school I would like been bedridden probably
"
148,SP1,"yeah
"
149,SP2,"And like so close to finals especially that we have just and such a nightmare
"
150,SP1,"And like not being yeah
"
151,SP2,"Yeah

"
389,SP2,"mhm
"
390,SP1,"like if you think think think you're comfortable w ith it like we can totally is if not like if there's like one person was uncomfo rtable with it like the neck we won't use it off like Texas anonymous and everything thank every decided that we were fine with it um  but then this really becomes the complete like it did make an option which i s like no other feelings at all and it's really just because like tha t's really the exclusionary to like other freshman because like when you coming in like you're in the call the things about your fo family to fan and stuff like that
"
391,SP2,"mhm
"
392,SP1,"and then um there's some people who like

402,SP1,"Most of the days like you doing like one or two like service sites o n and the support staff is really like there like help like everyone a little psych the courts with definitely need but then also like to like drive them to difference as because now everything's in like Medford or Somerville a Boston like some of it's like I was like an hour away
"
403,SP2,"mhm
"
404,SP1,"so there's like sports stuff is like intro to psych driving in t he picking up sites and then like one of the places um but like eve ry group also has an off day and on the off to like they can do like whate ver they want and like they have to get like amount of money like they can spend to like the one he's a good go to a restaurant like went to Boston link  could convince

415,SP1,"yeah
"
416,SP1,"But I think it's just like yeah
"
417,SP1,"It's interesting for like some leaders I know who like go and like expect to like I have like a really like tight knit group and stuff like it hasn' t always like like out like that just because like
"
418,SP2,"Yeah
"
419,SP1,"Yeah it's like something like I'm like

"
429,SP2,"Like I kind of just to me it sounded like I am a this is the
"
430,SP2,"All say that doesn't actually happen kind of thing I like in my go roup I'm like I wasn't that close with like everyone in the group bu t like um like to people in the group I had connections with anyway s because basically there was one girl who um was kind of a family friend like because um our dad used to work together
