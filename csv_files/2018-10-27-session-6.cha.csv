"
116,SP1,"There's too many people I keep meeting new people from it and I'm like really you're in this class
"
117,SP2,"it's so many people you just blend in
"
118,SP1,"Even worse was when I found out that guys live across the hall from me are in that class and sit in the rowbehind me
"
119,SP2,"uhuh
"
120,SP2,"Really
"
121,SP1,"Like every class and I

"
124,SP2,"Okay
"
125,SP1,"uh Like two like second or third row
"
126,SP2,"Okay I'm always in the back left I don't know why I always I'm like the last one there I like never get front
"
127,SP1,"that helps no it's not a psychological reason
"
128,SP2,"No
"
129,SP2,"I don't think so
"
130,SP1,"Yeah that's exciting I don't know I kinda like the way that class is taught
"
131,SP2,"Yeah
"
132,SP1,"oh and they're
"
133,SP2,"I like how it's both of them
"
134,SP1,"Yeah
"
135,SP2,"they're both so cool
"
136,SP1,"Because I feel like I'd get tired of it if it was the same person every day lecturing me the same way
"
137,SP2,"Yeah
"
138,SP1,"Like it keeps us off balance it's nice
"
139,SP2,"Yeah definitely
"
140,SP1,"and they lecture so differently which is nice too
"
141,SP2,"I now it's the videos the other day were so funny
"
142,SP1,"yeah
"
143,SP1,"that helps every time they show the office I'm like have you seen that episode
"
144,SP2,"they were
"
145,SP2,"I haven't seen the office
"
146,SP1,"it's worth watching
"
147,SP2,"I've watched
"
148,SP1,"It's worth I just started it like two weeks ago
"
149,SP2,"I want to watch it but I just like don't have time
"
150,SP1,"Yeah
"
151,SP2,"It'll be a summer thing
"
152,SP1,"See I watched like one episode a day so I'm
"
153,SP2,"oh
"
154,SP1,"Maybe two
"
155,SP2,"And they're quick right they're like twenty minutes
"
156,SP1,"And there's t twenty minute episodes yeah
"
157,SP2,"Yeah
"
158,SP1,"Um I think one of the seasons has all forty minute episodes but it's half the amount of episodes
"
159,SP2,"Okay
"
160,SP1,"So
"
161,SP1,"I don't know why they did that
"
162,SP2,"Yeah that's weird
"
163,SP1,"But
"
164,SP2,"To change it up
"
165,SP1,"No it's a good show cause all my other um shows that I was quote unquote binging um ended so
"
166,SP2,"oh okay
"
167,SP1,"or I finished them already
"
168,SP2,"ohh
"
169,SP1,"So that helps I had been anyone
"
170,SP2,"Yep the office I've I've heard nothing but good things about it
"
171,SP1,"Yeah
"
172,SP2,"I just like don't
"
173,SP1,"I haven't had any bad experience with it yet
"
174,SP2,"Yeah I just don't usually watch like co like funny shows

175,SP1,"what do you watch usually
"
176,SP2,"I'm
"
177,SP2,"I like crime shows
"
178,SP1,"oo
"
179,SP2,"and like that sort of thing
"
180,SP1,"like law and order kind of thing
"
181,SP2,"Yeah like law and order like criminal minds
"
182,SP1,"those those are cool shows
"
183,SP2,"They're cool they're weird sometimes
"
184,SP1,"most the time yeah it's well done though
"
185,SP2,"Yeah
"
186,SP1,"yeah they do a good job with it
"
187,SP2,"SVU is a really good
"
188,SP1,"Never watched SVU people tell me to I've never done it never actually gone through with it
"
189,SP2,"It's a good show
"
190,SP1,"I'll have to check it out
"
191,SP2,"If you ever have time
"
192,SP1,"I only have time for one episoode a day of the office so
"
193,SP2,"That's what happened on SVU
"
194,SP1,"And then pretend that's still part of the same episode of the office
"
195,SP2,"Yeah
"
196,SP1,"see if it matches up
"
197,SP2,"exactly
"
198,SP1,"Testing
"
199,SP2,"ugh
"
200,SP1,"Yeah
"
201,SP1,"mostly just too tired to do things now

"
208,SP2,"For practice otherwise I wouldn't have gotten out of bed
"
209,SP1,"Yeah I looked outside like when I woke up I'm like is it really one oclock it's kinda dark
"
210,SP2,"It's just like today was one of those days where you can't really do anything
"
211,SP1,"Yeah that made sense
"
212,SP2,"It's just too gross out
"
213,SP1,"tried to go to the gym but when I got there I was soaked so like it ruined the whole gym experience
"
214,SP2,"ugh Like when your shoes are wet
"
215,SP1,"My shoes are soaked right now
"
216,SP2,"You can't do anything
"
217,SP1,"It's terrible

218,SP2,"I just reali I forgot that I packed my rain boots so I just pulled 'em out today
"
219,SP1,"Really
"
220,SP2,"Yeah
"
221,SP1,"I don't have rain boots I do have a contact that's hurting but that's okay
"
222,SP2,"oh no
"
223,SP1,"It'll be fine it happens like when I get rainwater in my eye
"
224,SP1,"You know typical things
"
225,SP2,"I know my g ay my contacts I wear contacts too they're a lifesaver
"
226,SP2,"I hate when I hate glasses
"
227,SP1,"Yeah
"
228,SP1,"I hate glasses too but I have 'em in case I need them
"
229,SP2,"Yeah
"
230,SP2,"yeah
"
231,SP1,"One day I forgot to take my contacts out at night
"
232,SP2,"oh
"
233,SP1,"And I woke up my eyes were like totally bloodshot
"
234,SP2,"I hate that
"
235,SP1,"So when I took my contacts out like I just started like with my glasses on
"
236,SP2,"mhm
"
237,SP1,"I went downstairs and someonoe was like are you okay like they thought I was like really in really bad shape I'm like no I just didn't take my contacts out overnight but like people were looking at me really funny all day
"
238,SP2,"Yeah
"
239,SP1,"I t was like are you are you good like my teacher pulled me aside after class
"
240,SP2,"oh no
"
241,SP1,"and asked me if I was um doing okay I'm like yeah I just it's not that big a d it's fine
"
242,SP2,"just forgot my contacts
"
243,SP1,"Yeah
"
244,SP2,"No I like I've done that before and then I wake up and I'm like oh I can see now and then and then it's a disappointment when I would like have to take them out
"
245,SP1,"hmm
"
246,SP1,"What happens
"
247,SP2,"I hate it
"
248,SP1,"It's a miracle
"
249,SP2,"I know
"
250,SP1,"Yeah I don't know contacts are annoying but better than glasses
"
251,SP2,"Yes
"
252,SP1,"Yeah
"
253,SP2,"like I just hate Wallich you can't see everything with glasses
"
254,SP1,"it's the peripheral vision that's thrown off
"
255,SP2,"Yeah and like when I'm like especially when I'm going downstair like walking downstairs with them on
"
256,SP1,"oh Yeah
"
257,SP2,"cause then I
"
258,SP1,"they shake a little bit ansd said
"
259,SP2,"Yeah and like I'll see through my glasses and then I'll also see like
"
260,SP2,"with my glasses off like
"
261,SP1,"Yeah like
"
262,SP2,"When I looked down down like I can't see anything it's just blurry
"
263,SP1,"You'll see like just below anything at it's awful
"
264,SP2,"Then I get thrown off
"
265,SP1,"Even worse so like before I wore contacts like the glasses made sense but now that I've worn contacts f for a good amount of time now When I put the glasses on everything is like so different
"
266,SP2,"Yeah
"
267,SP2,"Yeah like you can't go back
"
268,SP1,"Yeah I do every once in a while because I have to
"
269,SP2,"It's a weird
"
270,SP2,"mhm
"
271,SP1,"But like
"
272,SP1,"It's so weird
"
273,SP2,"Yeah it's like getting your eyes a break or whatever they say but like I I'm like no that's not happening
"
274,SP1,"Yeah it's it is what it is
"
275,SP2,"Yeah
"
276,SP1,"Yeah even worse is like when you go a couple days in a row where you've like stayed up too late and wear the contacts for a long period of time
"
277,SP2,"Yeah
"
278,SP1,"And then like your eyes are just generally bloodshot
"
279,SP2,"I know
"
280,SP1,"It's awful
"
281,SP2,"And I hate the like the dry feeling
"
282,SP1,"Yeah
"
283,SP2,"Like when you keep them in and it's just like they kind of get like stuck to your eye
"
284,SP1,"Yeah yeah
"
285,SP2,"It sucks
"
286,SP1,"One time I um tried to take my contact out my contact must have fallen out though so like I'm just pulling out my eye for like thirty minutes
"
287,SP2,"oh no
"
288,SP1,"I was like panicking because I was at a concert so like I got home and I went to take them Out I just didn't have one of them in they were just must have fallen out
"
289,SP2,"that's so funny
"
290,SP1,"The scariest part is that I drove home like I drove home with only one contact in and don't even notice
"
291,SP2,"That's so weir is there what's your prescription is it that
"
292,SP1,"it's not that bad but I have like a really bad astigmatism
"
293,SP2,"uh huh
"
294,SP1,"so
"
295,SP2,"Okay
"
296,SP1,"I should noticed it would've thrown me off
"
297,SP1,"but I don't know
"
298,SP2,"That's funny
"
299,SP1,"I I didn't notice
"
300,SP2,"Yeah I couldn't do that my eyes are too bad
"
301,SP1,"Yeah
"
302,SP2,"I like
"
303,SP1,"Happens
"
304,SP2,"I wanna get Lazic but it scares me
"
305,SP1,"It was a little scary
"
306,SP2,"it's a lil s
"
307,SP1,"Putting lasers in yeah
"
308,SP2,"I know I'm way too scared not till I'm way older
"
309,SP1,"Yeah I was scared of contacts forever if I contact like six months like
"
310,SP2,"oh really
"
311,SP1,"I had like an enormous unnecessary fear for like poking my eyes
"
312,SP2,"That's so i interesting
"
313,SP1,"um Like I had nothing to cause the fear
"
314,SP2,"Uh huh
"
315,SP1,"I just had that fear
"
316,SP2,"That's so weird
"
317,SP1,"Uhm but then I was like fuck it I'll get contacts and that's definitely on video
"
318,SP2,"Like the con it's like the conditioning or whatever
"
319,SP1,"yeah finishing
"
320,SP2,"Yeah
"
321,SP1,"yeah
"
322,SP2,"That's so funny I got it when I was like
"
323,SP2,"Ten
"
324,SP2,"Nine or ten cause I needed 'em for soccer cause like I couldn't
"
325,SP1,"Yeah I should on that
"
326,SP1,"my makes sense
"
327,SP2,"I didn't want to wear the like goggles
"
328,SP1,"see I just wore the my regular glasses when I played soccer when I was younger
"
329,SP2,"uh huh
"
330,SP1,"and they would always like fall off or I'd get hit in the face the ball
"
331,SP2,"Yeah
"
332,SP1,"like I couldn't do headers like
"
333,SP2,"Yeah
"
334,SP1,"I lost a whole point of the game
"
335,SP2,"Exactly
"
336,SP1,"Actually every sport I played a somehow at some point either break a pair of glasses or get hit in the face or like
"
337,SP2,"Yeah
"
338,SP1,"something always went wrong
"
339,SP2,"Yeah
"
340,SP1,"yeah
"
341,SP2,"that's so f
"
342,SP1,"except for cross country I never had problems with glasses in cross country
"
343,SP2,"No
"
344,SP2,"do you still do are you still playing any sports
"
345,SP1,"uh no I'm really good at getting hurt
"
346,SP2,"No
"
347,SP2,"What have you at what are you injured
"
348,SP1,"I've injured like everything you can name a bone or place in my body I've hurt it
"
349,SP2,"oh gosh really
"
350,SP1,"It's yeah most likely doing something clumsy not even not even playing sports
"
351,SP2,"That's f
"
352,SP1,"Like I had three concussions in a month once
"
353,SP2,"not good
"
354,SP1,"I don't play any contact sports
"
355,SP2,"what
"
356,SP1,"Yeah
"
357,SP2,"how
"
358,SP1,"well first one I got in choior
"
359,SP2,"Okay
"
360,SP1,"Um my friend accidentally hti me in the head
"
361,SP2,"oh gosh
"
362,SP1,"So it was a small one the day I came back from that concussion someone hit me in the face with a basketball just like down like in the hall um the day I came back from that concussion I tripped and fell hit my head on a metal pole
"
363,SP2,"That's such bad luck
"
364,SP1,"Yeah it's fine I mean it's tough I couldn't have lost that much brain cells
"
365,SP2,"My friend had one and she was out of school for like two months
"
366,SP1,"Damn
"
367,SP2,"it was terrible
"
368,SP1,"Was a sports concussion though
"
369,SP2,"Yeah so she was heading the she's a center back
"
370,SP1,"That makes sense
"
371,SP1,"Okay
"
372,SP2,"And she was heading the ball and like it hit her too high up instead of on the forehead
"
373,SP1,"that makes sense
"
374,SP2,"And she lost s like it was during our junior junior year of high school and she couldn't play or she couldn't she stopped playing after she got the concussion cause she was too afraid and then she like it affected all her like ACTs SATs and like all of our classes
"
375,SP1,"Yeah
"
376,SP1,"that's awful
"
377,SP2,"She made it to Duke so I think she's doing okay
"
378,SP1,"I think she's doing fine
"
379,SP2,"Doesn't really matter
"
380,SP1,"yeah
"
381,SP2,"It worked out
"
382,SP1,"at least it worked out
"
383,SP2,"Injuries suck though

387,SP2,"I don't even know not to have major stuff but like even like little injuries I've had a concussion before
"
388,SP1,"Yeah
"
389,SP2,"But
"
390,SP1,"none of my c my three concussions were major so like
"
391,SP2,"Yeah
"
392,SP1,"I was out of school for like a week each
"
393,SP2,"uh huh
"
394,SP1,"um but the three in a row was what the problem was
"
395,SP2,"Yeah that sets you back a lot
"
396,SP1,"yeah
"
397,SP1,"it's okay it was my freshman year so I was I didn't have that much to do
"
398,SP2,"oh
"

419,SP2,"So cool
"
420,SP1,"it's exciting
"

"
422,SP2,"is it like new for you or have you done comedy before
"
423,SP1,"I'm
"
424,SP1,"I've done comedy before just it's been a while
"
425,SP2,"uh huh
"
426,SP1,"Like I did comedy when I was like thirteen
"
427,SP2,"Okay
"
428,SP1,"and like before I had any idea of what was actually funny
"
429,SP2,"Yeah
"
430,SP1,"um So now it's different like I'm writing jokes like all the time
"
431,SP2,"uh huh
"
432,SP1,"now cause it's just finally I'll think of something funny and I'll write it down where as before I wouldn't think to write that down I would just like
"
433,SP2,"Yeah
"
434,SP1,"Think of something funny
"
435,SP2,"That's so fun
"
436,SP2,"that's so interesting
"
437,SP1,"So
"
438,SP1,"yeah even better is when I actually have the tell the jokes um because sometimes I'll just write down a a key word
"
439,SP2,"Yeah
"
440,SP1,"like a like a word that if anyone read it like they would have no idea what I possibly mean by that
"
441,SP2,"Yeah
"
442,SP1,"and then sometimes I'll forget what they mean
"
443,SP2,"Uh huh
"
444,SP1,"and it ruins the whole joke I'll just be like binoculars I don't know that joke is like
"
445,SP2,"Is it like scripted when you do it or is it more
"
446,SP1,"Some of it's scripted mostly not though it's mostly like I've written like part of a joke down and I'll like no matter how I tell it that's the joke is
"
447,SP2,"Okay
"
448,SP1,"I try to write as little as possible down so I can like consolidate space
"
449,SP2,"uh huh
"
450,SP1,"Um but other jokes have to be scripted because I can't be told otherwise
"
451,SP2,"Yeah so like tonight when you go to the thing will you like have a set like something like prepared for it or is it more just like you'll go up there and
"
452,SP1,"I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to do it memorized
"
453,SP2,"Okay
"
454,SP1,"um but I have a s I have a set prepared kind of
"
455,SP2,"Yeah
"
456,SP1,"um I haven't really memorized it but I should start doing it some point
"
457,SP2,"In the next hour
"
458,SP2,"Or so
"
459,SP1,"Yeah I'll figure it out
"
460,SP2,"yeah
"
461,SP1,"I haven't done a show memorized yet
"
462,SP2,"mhm
"
463,SP1,"so I wanted to do one
"
464,SP2,"feel like that would be hard it's more important I feel like to get the joke down
"
465,SP1,"Yeah
"
466,SP2,"Right maybe
"
467,SP1,"I'll probably be telling jokes I've already told tonight
"
468,SP2,"I don't know
"
469,SP2,"Yeah
"
470,SP1,"Um but it's a new audience so they haven't heard 'em
"
471,SP2,"That's cool

"
549,SP2,"My gosh

"
554,SP2,"Yeah like they can't get worse
"
555,SP1,"just yeah
"
556,SP1,"they're not gonna get any worse
"
557,SP2,"They're just painful
"
558,SP1,"the worst that could happen
"
559,SP1,"Like is if you like hit your shin on something while you had shin splints
"
560,SP2,"mhm
"
561,SP1,"then you could get a fracture cause your shins are weaker
"
562,SP2,"Yep
"
563,SP1,"but it's mostly just pain
"
564,SP2,"mhm

573,SP1,"Well yeah um when you run every day eventually Eventually it hits too much in some people
"
574,SP2,"oh It's too much
"
575,SP2,"Yeah and our feet feet are so important
"
576,SP1,"Yeah you know you forget how how easy it walking is until you're like hurt
"
577,SP2,"Yeah
"
578,SP1,"like I
"
579,SP1,"at the time like I thought everything was normal and then I got hurt and I was like shit it's so slow like I was so slow getting places

"
661,SP1,"Yeah we
"
662,SP1,"we get along um the one who left was still hangs out with us
"
663,SP2,"oh
"
664,SP1,"um
"
665,SP2,"Did he just he's still at the school
"
666,SP1,"He just couldn't sleep
"
667,SP1,"he just he switched um dorm buildings
"
668,SP2,"oh was he in a top bunk or some
"
669,SP1,"he just couldn't sleep
"
670,SP1,"Yeah the other two of us aren't cause we put we put ours down
"
671,SP2,"Okay
"
672,SP1,"Which um means we have very little space in the room but we can sleep so
"
673,SP2,"oh so he was was he lofted
"
674,SP1,"Yeah
"
675,SP2,"Okay
"
676,SP1,"so
"
677,SP2,"So ours is like a lo we have the Hill dorms I've seen used
"
678,SP1,"hills are huge
"
679,SP2,"they're so big so the doubles are nor like p a Wonderful size
"
680,SP1,"Yeah
"
681,SP2,"but ours is just like the exact same size but with three people living in it so it feels way smaller so like we have a lofted bed with she's all our stuff underneath and then we have our bunk bed
"
682,SP1,"mhm
"
683,SP2,"and I was the last of the rooms so on the top of the bunkbed
"
684,SP1,"mmm
"
685,SP2,"which kind of sucks but it's kinda cozy up there
"
686,SP1,"that works
"
687,SP2,"It just sucks cause I can't fold my laundry
"
688,SP1,"oof
"
689,SP2,"It's hard to do that
"
690,SP1,"Yeah I don't I I feel like living in Hill has a lot of benefits
"
691,SP2,"mhm
"
692,SP1,"like room size being one of them
"
693,SP2,"Yeah
"
694,SP1,"Like she probably don't feel like it's that forced of a triple like there's still plenty of space in your room
"
695,SP2,"Yeah exactly like it's not like claustrophobic by any means
"
696,SP1,"Like I can reach from the end of my bed to the end of my um roommates' bed
"
697,SP2,"Like because the like
"
698,SP1,"like cause the way it's set up at this point like it's not that far it's like three feet
"
699,SP2,"mhm
"
700,SP2,"Did you get the third bed moved out
"
701,SP1,"Not yet
"
702,SP1,"Um because apparently you're supposed to pay for that
"
703,SP2,"what
"
704,SP1,"I thought that was silly but I don't know I'm still talking with res life about it
"
705,SP2,"mhm That's ridic
"
706,SP1,"They haven't gotten back to me
"
707,SP2,"The guy who moved out should help you out with that
"
708,SP1,"Yeah we'll figure it out um worst case scenario we don't move it out because we've been using his storage space
"
709,SP2,"Okay
"
710,SP1,"So
"
711,SP2,"That's nice though
"
712,SP1,"not a big deal
"
713,SP2,"Yeah
"
714,SP1,"Worst case scenario it's nothing happens so
"
715,SP2,"Yeah
"
716,SP1,"wa we've been living fine in the first place
"
717,SP2,"mhm It works out
"
718,SP1,"Yeah the Hills dorms are just huge
"
719,SP2,"I know
"
720,SP1,"like my friend's in a single there and her room's bigger than mine
"
721,SP2,"She's in a single
"
722,SP1,"Yeah
"
723,SP2,"That's so nice
"
724,SP1,"I wouldn't ever want to live in a single
"
725,SP2,"I feel like singles I don't know I at least as a freshman I definitely wouldn't want to
"
726,SP1,"Yeah
"
727,SP2,"But in some ways they're nice to just be like
"
728,SP1,"It's nice to have the privacy but like you lose that already key scial output
"
729,SP2,"Yeah
"
730,SP2,"Yes
"
731,SP1,"So
"
732,SP2,"Like I feel like it's harder to make friends maybe
"
733,SP1,"Yeah little bit
"
734,SP2,"I don't know
"
735,SP1,"Not a big deal
"
736,SP2,"Yeah do you like uphill or d well you're down hill so do you eat at

741,SP1,"I'm sure you get Carm
"
742,SP2,"I like Dewick so much better
"
743,SP1,"Dewick is better better it's that's known
"
744,SP2,"But Carm is just like so much more convenient
"
745,SP1,"I think we should start calling Dewick just just Mcby just throw people off
"
746,SP2,"Change it up
"
747,SP1,"I mean it wouldn't change the person is just what it is
"
748,SP2,"Yeah that's funny
"
749,SP1,"Yeah
"
750,SP2,"people would be so confused
"
751,SP1,"I got people call south um Harleston cause somebody else put money into it
"
752,SP2,"I know
"
753,SP1,"Um but most people still call it south
"
754,SP2,"Yeah

759,SP2,"Poor McPhee

762,SP2,"no this is it one person or is it two
"
763,SP1,"I think it's two people
"
764,SP2,"Yeah
"
765,SP2,"like Dewick isn't the first name
"
766,SP1,"um
"
767,SP1,"No
"
768,SP2,"It's Dewick
"
769,SP1,"I don't think Dewick's a first name
"
770,SP2,"they're both the last name
"
771,SP1,"No my name is Dewick that's that'd be weird yeah
"
772,SP2,"no
"
773,SP2,"Dewick MacPhee I don't know
"
774,SP1,"I don't know what it's d do
"
775,SP2,"That's like there's so many Tisch buildings

778,SP1,"All the Tisch family's the Tisch family's ridiculously wealthy
"
779,SP2,"Yeah
"
780,SP1,"Like they own the they own the New York Giants

781,SP2,"Okay
"
782,SP1,"So like if they can own a sports team they can buy buildings at all these colleges
"
783,SP2,"Yeah
"
784,SP1,"Like almost every major college like has a Tisch building of some kind
"
785,SP2,"I just don't get what the purpose of that is
"
786,SP1,"Like investing their money into schools
"
787,SP2,"Yeah
"
788,SP1,"Higher education
"
789,SP2,"Yeah
"
790,SP1,"I don't know that's what their that's what they believe in
"
791,SP2,"that's Nice
"
792,SP1,"Some people believe in investing in like more and more real estate to make more money they believe in investing in peoples' futures
"
793,SP2,"mhm
"
794,SP2,"That's cool
"
795,SP1,"By building Nice gyms
"
796,SP2,"didn't think about it that way
"
797,SP2,"The gyms
"
798,SP1,"yeah
"
799,SP2,"Keep the s Tufts students healthy
"
800,SP1,"let's fight obesity let's put a giant hill right here
"
801,SP1,"That'll help
"
802,SP2,"So after you work out you have to walk up hill again
"
803,SP1,"Might have killer calves
"
804,SP2,"oh yeah
"
805,SP1,"That's the whole goal
"
806,SP2,"ugh
"
807,SP1,"like if I had a set three goals for my entire time at Tufts the top three goals would all be to get killer calves
"
808,SP2,"I feel like wa I have to every time I'm our field is down hill
"
809,SP1,"Okay
"
810,SP2,"so like everyday the walk from
"
811,SP2,"Craft to Hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far
"
812,SP1,"Yeah
"
813,SP2,"And three days a week I have French right after practice
"
814,SP1,"ooo
"
815,SP2,"so either way I'm going like all the way to Olin
"
816,SP1,"it's far
"
817,SP2,"and it's just miserable
"
818,SP2,"It's so far
"
819,SP1,"Yeah
"
820,SP2,"especially now that it's cold it's pretty bad
"
821,SP1,"but Being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class like you're at the same level as the classes like I have to walk uphill to every class
"
822,SP2,"Yeah
"
823,SP2,"That's true
"
824,SP1,"and have enough of a break time in between classes where I have to go back to my dorm to like do like do work and do things
"
825,SP2,"mhm
"
826,SP2,"Yeah
"
827,SP1,"And then go back to class so I'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum
"
828,SP2,"Yeah where are most of your classes
"
829,SP1,"um probably like they're in the academic quad mostly
"
830,SP2,"Okay
"
831,SP1,"But um it's nice I have one class in Granoff so
"
832,SP2,"uhuh
"
833,SP1,"I don't have to walk very far for that
"
834,SP2,"That's nice yeah mine is I've one in Granoff too and then
"
835,SP2,"I have one in Eaton so that's Kinda
"
836,SP1,"Okay
"
837,SP2,"I don't know what that counts as
"
838,SP1,"think it's still the academic quad
"
839,SP2,"Yeah and then Olin and then psych
"
840,SP1,"Yeah
"
841,SP2,"So
"
842,SP1,"Not bad
"
843,SP2,"Not bad
"
844,SP1,"it works out
"
845,SP2,"Yeah I feel like if I were coming from Hil Oli like going to Olin and going to psych would be so easy
"
846,SP1,"Yeah
"
847,SP2,"But like Eaton in Granoff doesn't really ap matter
"
848,SP1,"Yeah Granoff's really easy for me
"
849,SP2,"It would be the same from anywhere
"
850,SP2,"yeah
"
851,SP1,"cause it's like a one minute walk from Hodge
"
852,SP2,"Yeah I have four classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays
"
853,SP1,"Really
"
854,SP2,"But then on I have no classes Wednesday and I only have one class on Monday and Friday so it's like a weird like I a pretty much always have a four day weekend
"
855,SP1,"that works
"
856,SP2,"Which is nice
"
857,SP1,"Yeah I set up my classes differently I have two on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday
"
858,SP2,"Okay
"
859,SP1,"And then I have one recitation on Friday
"
860,SP2,"That's nice
"
861,SP1,"um so it works out
"
862,SP2,"that's really evenly broken up
"
863,SP1,"Yeah and I thought that would be beneficial it's not
"
864,SP2,"You don't like it
"
865,SP1,"it just means I have work due every day
"
866,SP2,"yeah that's what I like about having Wednesdays off
"
867,SP1,"mhm
"
868,SP2,"cause like I don't really have to do stuff Tuesday night
"
869,SP1,"Yeah
"
870,SP2,"But like I can if I wanna get ahead and then I don't have to do anything Thursday nights
"
871,SP1,"That works
"
872,SP2,"Like I would do it again I think but I also end up wasting a lot of time cause my classes like if I don't I don't have class till six PM on Monday
"
873,SP2,"so I end up just like sleeping in too late
"
874,SP1,"Really
"
875,SP2,"But you get you get you get
"
876,SP1,"Yeah I mean I have class at nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays I hate that
"
877,SP2,"Yeah
"
878,SP1,"And it's so early
"
879,SP2,"I have yeah I have I have that too
"
880,SP1,"And it's weird cause like I had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school
"
881,SP2,"I have English
"
882,SP2,"mhm
"
883,SP1,"Like I thought that was early and I think this is early even though it's later
"
884,SP2,"Yeah like getting up at eight
"
885,SP1,"I think it's
"
886,SP2,"like I get up at eight for my nine ams
"
887,SP1,"Yeah
"
888,SP2,"I feel like next semster I'm gonna try and go for everything after ten
"
889,SP1,"yeah for sure
"
890,SP2,"Especially cause now like at least first semester I can't have any classes between three and five six three and six so like I have the that whole chunk of time likeI couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now I'm more flexible
"
891,SP1,"that makes sense
"
892,SP1,"Yeah cause of soccer sports yeah
"
893,SP2,"Yeah but I'm still trying to have Wednesdays off it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week
"
894,SP1,"it breaks up the week yeah that would be that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off
"
895,SP2,"Yeah it's like you don't like Fridays off are nice but having one class on Fridays isn't the end of the world
"
896,SP1,"no I have a rescitation that's not mandatory
"
897,SP2,"Yeah
"
898,SP1,"and like its
"
899,SP2,"what for what class is it
"
900,SP1,"for stats
"
901,SP2,"Okay
"
902,SP1,"Um I only have to show up if like when I pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance
"
903,SP2,"mhm
"
904,SP2,"Okay
"
905,SP1,"Um so that helps
"
906,SP2,"yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta
"
907,SP1,"e yes except for stats which has three
"
908,SP1,"Including rescitation
"
909,SP2,"Okay
"
910,SP2,"okay
"
911,SP1,"But yeah it's nice
"
912,SP2,"Yeah
"
913,SP1,"One of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes
"
914,SP2,"Uhhuh
"
915,SP1,"And he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class I mean
"
916,SP2,"Yeah
"
917,SP1,"and Like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either
"
918,SP2,"mhm
"
919,SP1,"on Fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory
"
920,SP2,"oh my gosh I'm worried for next semester cause I'm trying to take five classes
"
921,SP1,"Same though
"
922,SP2,"And then like most of them like if I take econ I'll have a rescitation
"
923,SP1,"Okay
"
924,SP2,"French two will have a rescitation
"
925,SP1,"Yeah
"
926,SP2,"I wanna take computer science
"
927,SP1,"I do too but I don't know when I want to take it
"
928,SP2,"I know
"
929,SP1,"Like I want to take next semester but I feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it
"
930,SP2,"I know
"
931,SP1,"I don't it want to be a super busy clas I want to be able to like learn well for that class
"
932,SP2,"Yeah
"
933,SP2,"I've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all
"
934,SP1,"well I don't know which is which
"
935,SP2,"I know I need to figure it out too my one friend was like
"
936,SP1,"Rate my professor
"
937,SP2,"Yeah
"
938,SP1,"work works really well
"
939,SP2,"that is a good one
"
940,SP2,"my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever
"
941,SP1,"Yeah
"
942,SP1,"That works
"
943,SP2,"So we'll see
"
944,SP1,"Yeah
"
945,SP2,"Yeah
"
946,SP1,"I don't know
"
947,SP2,"I I just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was
"
948,SP1,"Yeah that's how I feel
"
949,SP2,"But
"
950,SP1,"I took four pretty easy classes
"
951,SP2,"Yeah me too
"
952,SP1,"Or classes that don't have a lot of work
"
953,SP2,"Yeah
"
954,SP1,"so ah
"
955,SP2,"Like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually
"
956,SP1,"It;s reading heavy
"
957,SP2,"it's reading heavy
"
958,SP1,"which takes a long time but isn't that hard
"
959,SP2,"Yeah and like I feel like my notes I'm so particular about how I take my notes that it takes even longer like
"
960,SP1,"Do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read
"
961,SP2,"So I like have tried everything like oh I used to go paragraph by paragraph which I know you're not supposed to do
"
962,SP1,"mhm
"
963,SP2,"but so then like this past time for chapter eight I would read through
"
964,SP2,"All of eight point one like eight one A B C or whatever and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like I knew like I didn't have to re read each paragraph
"
965,SP2,"I kinda knew what was going on
"
966,SP1,"Okay
"
967,SP2,"Um but that took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four
"
968,SP1,"Really
"
969,SP2,"Like I sat in Tisch from seven to eleven
"
970,SP1,"Damn
"
971,SP2,"doing psych [ ]
"
972,SP1,"that's that's tough
"
973,SP2,"And it's like it's such a it's like not a waste a time but like I could have been I feel like there's got to be a better way to do it
"
974,SP1,"See I don't take notes at all when I read cause I'll just get distracted by it like I'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading
"
975,SP2,"Yeah
"
976,SP1,"and I won't learn as much from it
"
977,SP2,"uh huh
"
978,SP1,"I like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book
"
979,SP2,"Yeah
"
980,SP1,"and I'll go back and do those after
"
981,SP1,"Just so I really master it
"
982,SP2,"Like the the quizzes or the
"
983,SP1,"Yeah like a flash cards and quizzes I can go back and do those
"
984,SP2,"Yeah maybe I'll try that for chapter ten
"
985,SP1,"Yeah
"
986,SP2,"Like I just feel like if I get through chapter nine I'll be fine cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning
"
987,SP1,"yeah
"
988,SP1,"Yeah
"
989,SP2,"And then I'll just be able to like I can just review extra for it
"
990,SP1,"Yeah
"
991,SP2,"for test on Thursday
"
992,SP1,"That works it's the balance that I just take like really like really affected notes in class
"
993,SP2,"Yeah
"
994,SP1,"or I'll write down more than I necessarily
"
995,SP2,"Yeah
"
996,SP1,"but just so I have it
"
997,SP2,"Yeah
"
998,SP1,"Yeah
"
999,SP2,"I feel like
"
1000,SP2,"My class notes could be better but it's also like I I feel like I don't pay as much attention in class because I know I have the reading to fall back on
"
1001,SP1,"Okay yeah
"
1002,SP2,"But like that's not good like I need to be paying attention in class but we'll see
"
1003,SP1,"I get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture I'm like okay I I I g I not really getting right now just like go for further reading
"
1004,SP2,"Yeah
"
1005,SP1,"Um in the sometimes right the opposite world like I'll read it after like a lecture and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this do
"
1006,SP1,"this doesn't make as much sense anymore
"
1007,SP2,"mhm
"
1008,SP2,"Yeah
"
1009,SP1,"so but it is what it is I got
"
1010,SP2,"Yeah
"
1011,SP1,"It's really just studying for exams and learning the material
"
1012,SP2,"Yeah
"
1013,SP2,"exactly and like the I feel like this exam will be a little easier to study for
"
1014,SP1,"well not that we've seen the exam questions
"
1015,SP2,"Yeah
"
1016,SP1,"from the first one we know how to do it
"
1017,SP2,"Yes and like it's not as much it's not as specific I feel like the material
"
1018,SP1,"Yeah
"
1019,SP2,"it's more theories and like vague stuff
"
1020,SP1,"A little more vague
"
1021,SP2,"whereas like last time we had to know like all the different functions
"
1022,SP1,"yeah
"
1023,SP2,"and I was like lots of flash cards with that one
"
1024,SP1,"I spend so much time just making flashcards and then I found out they had like the flash cards built in
"
1025,SP2,"I know
"
1026,SP1,"And I was like really did I just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason
"
1027,SP2,"That's all my friends did the same thing and I just like I ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before like I took super diligent notes
"
1028,SP2,"which made it easier
"
1029,SP1,"mhm
"
1030,SP2,"but I'm not doing that this time like I need to start studying tomorrow
"
1031,SP1,"You know I promised myself I'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time
"
1032,SP1,"Uh I didn't cause I just finished chapter eight so
"
1033,SP2,"Yeah I finished chapter eight on Thursday
"
1034,SP1,"I finished it
"
1035,SP2,"Wednesday Thursday
"
1036,SP1,"Yesterday so that was Friday
"
1037,SP2,"Yeah
"
1038,SP1,"Yeah
"
1039,SP2,"And chapter nine and ten are apparently really long
"
1040,SP1,"There's like five and six parts each
"
1041,SP2,"Yeah and like the within the individual sections like they all scroll
"
1042,SP1,"Yeah
"
1043,SP2,"for a really long time and I'm just like I can't do this
"
1044,SP1,"so much
"
1045,SP2,"Do you ever watch the videos
"
1046,SP1,"Yeah um if it seems like a short chapter
"
1047,SP2,"Yeah
"
