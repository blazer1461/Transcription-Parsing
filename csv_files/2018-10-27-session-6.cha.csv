"
456,SP1,"I try to write as little as possible down so I can like consolidate space 

743,SP2,"I feel like singles I don't know I at least as a freshman I definitely wouldn't want to 
"
744,SP1,"Yeah 
"
745,SP2,"But in some ways they're nice to just be like 
"
746,SP1,"It's nice to have the privacy but like you lose that already key scial output 
"
747,SP2,"Yeah 
"
748,SP2,"Yes 
"
749,SP1,"So 

760,SP2,"I like Dewick so much better 
"
761,SP1,"Dewick is better better it's that's known 
"
762,SP2,"But Carm is just like so much more convenient 
"
763,SP1,"I think we should start calling Dewick just just Mcby just throw people off 
"
764,SP2,"Change it up 
"
765,SP1,"I mean it wouldn't change the person is just what it is 
"
766,SP2,"Yeah that's funny 

"
768,SP2,"people would be so confused 
"
769,SP1,"I got people call south um Harleston cause somebody else put money into it 
"
770,SP2,"I know 
"
771,SP1,"Um but most people still call it south 
"
772,SP2,"Yeah 
"
773,SP1,"Like I feel like Macphie's being left out 
"
774,SP2,"Everyone knows it's south 
"
775,SP2,"Yeah 
"
776,SP1,"Yeah 
"
777,SP2,"Poor McPhee 
"
778,SP1,"Poor Macphie 
"
779,SP1,"Yeah 
"
780,SP2,"no this is it one person or is it two 
"
781,SP1,"I think it's two people 
"
782,SP2,"Yeah 
"
783,SP2,"like Dewick isn't the first name 
"
784,SP1,"um 
"
785,SP1,"No 
"
786,SP2,"It's Dewick 
"
787,SP1,"I don't think Dewick's a first name 
"
788,SP2,"they're both the last name 
"
789,SP1,"No my name is Dewick that's that'd be weird yeah 
"
790,SP2,"no 
"
791,SP2,"Dewick MacPhee I don't know 
"
792,SP1,"I don't know what it's d do 
"
793,SP2,"That's like there's so many Tisch buildings 
"
794,SP1,"Yeah 
"
795,SP2,"Like there's the library and then the gym 
"
796,SP1,"All the Tisch family's the Tisch family's ridiculously wealthy 
"
797,SP2,"Yeah 
"
798,SP1,"Like they own the they own the New York Giants 
"
799,SP2,"Okay 
"
800,SP1,"So like if they can own a sports team they can buy buildings at all these colleges 
"
801,SP2,"Yeah 
"
802,SP1,"Like almost every major college like has a Tisch building of some kind 
"
803,SP2,"I just don't get what the purpose of that is 
"
804,SP1,"Like investing their money into schools 
"
805,SP2,"Yeah 
"
806,SP1,"Higher education 
"
807,SP2,"Yeah 
"
808,SP1,"I don't know that's what their that's what they believe in 
"
809,SP2,"that's Nice 
"
810,SP1,"Some people believe in investing in like more and more real estate to make more money they believe in investing in peoples' futures 
"
811,SP2,"mhm 
"
812,SP2,"That's cool 
"
813,SP1,"By building Nice gyms 
"
814,SP2,"didn't think about it that way 
"
815,SP2,"The gyms 
"
816,SP1,"yeah 
"
817,SP2,"Keep the s Tufts students healthy 
"
818,SP1,"let's fight obesity let's put a giant hill right here 
"
819,SP1,"That'll help 
"
820,SP2,"So after you work out you have to walk up hill again 
"
821,SP1,"Might have killer calves 
"
822,SP2,"oh yeah 
"
823,SP1,"That's the whole goal 
"
824,SP2,"ugh 
"
825,SP1,"like if I had a set three goals for my entire time at Tufts the top three goals would all be to get killer calves 
"
826,SP2,"I feel like wa I have to every time I'm our field is down hill 
"
827,SP1,"Okay 
"
828,SP2,"so like everyday the walk from 
"
829,SP2,"Craft to Hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far 
"
830,SP1,"Yeah 
"
831,SP2,"And three days a week I have French right after practice 
"
832,SP1,"ooo 
"
833,SP2,"so either way I'm going like all the way to Olin 
"
834,SP1,"it's far 
"
835,SP2,"and it's just miserable 
"
836,SP2,"It's so far 
"
837,SP1,"Yeah 
"
838,SP2,"especially now that it's cold it's pretty bad 
"
839,SP1,"but Being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class like you're at the same level as the classes like I have to walk uphill to every class 
"
840,SP2,"Yeah 
"
841,SP2,"That's true 
"
842,SP1,"and have enough of a break time in between classes where I have to go back to my dorm to like do like do work and do things 
"
843,SP2,"mhm 
"
844,SP2,"Yeah 
"
845,SP1,"And then go back to class so I'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum 
"
846,SP2,"Yeah where are most of your classes 
"
847,SP1,"um probably like they're in the academic quad mostly 
"
848,SP2,"Okay 
"
849,SP1,"But um it's nice I have one class in Granoff so 
"
850,SP2,"uhuh 
"
851,SP1,"I don't have to walk very far for that 
"
852,SP2,"That's nice yeah mine is I've one in Granoff too and then 
"
853,SP2,"I have one in Eaton so that's Kinda 
"
854,SP1,"Okay 
"
855,SP2,"I don't know what that counts as 
"
856,SP1,"think it's still the academic quad 
"
857,SP2,"Yeah and then Olin and then psych 
"
858,SP1,"Yeah 
"
859,SP2,"So 
"
860,SP1,"Not bad 
"
861,SP2,"Not bad 
"
862,SP1,"it works out 
"
863,SP2,"Yeah I feel like if I were coming from Hil Oli like going to Olin and going to psych would be so easy 
"
864,SP1,"Yeah 
"
865,SP2,"But like Eaton in Granoff doesn't really ap matter 
"
866,SP1,"Yeah Granoff's really easy for me 
"
867,SP2,"It would be the same from anywhere 
"
868,SP2,"yeah 
"
869,SP1,"cause it's like a one minute walk from Hodge 
"
870,SP2,"Yeah I have four classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
"
871,SP1,"Really 
"
872,SP2,"But then on I have no classes Wednesday and I only have one class on Monday and Friday so it's like a weird like I a pretty much always have a four day weekend 
"
873,SP1,"that works 
"
874,SP2,"Which is nice 
"
875,SP1,"Yeah I set up my classes differently I have two on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday 
"
876,SP2,"Okay 
"
877,SP1,"And then I have one recitation on Friday 
"
878,SP2,"That's nice 
"
879,SP1,"um so it works out 
"
880,SP2,"that's really evenly broken up 
"
881,SP1,"Yeah and I thought that would be beneficial it's not 
"
882,SP2,"You don't like it 
"
883,SP1,"it just means I have work due every day 
"
884,SP2,"yeah that's what I like about having Wednesdays off 
"
885,SP1,"mhm 
"
886,SP2,"cause like I don't really have to do stuff Tuesday night 
"
887,SP1,"Yeah 
"
888,SP2,"But like I can if I wanna get ahead and then I don't have to do anything Thursday nights 
"
889,SP1,"That works 
"
890,SP2,"Like I would do it again I think but I also end up wasting a lot of time cause my classes like if I don't I don't have class till six PM on Monday 
"
891,SP2,"so I end up just like sleeping in too late 
"
892,SP1,"Really 
"
893,SP2,"But you get you get you get 
"
894,SP1,"Yeah I mean I have class at nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays I hate that 
"
895,SP2,"Yeah 
"
896,SP1,"And it's so early 
"
897,SP2,"I have yeah I have I have that too 
"
898,SP1,"And it's weird cause like I had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school 
"
899,SP2,"I have English 
"
900,SP2,"mhm 
"
901,SP1,"Like I thought that was early and I think this is early even though it's later 
"
902,SP2,"Yeah like getting up at eight 
"
903,SP1,"I think it's 
"
904,SP2,"like I get up at eight for my nine ams 
"
905,SP1,"Yeah 
"
906,SP2,"I feel like next semster I'm gonna try and go for everything after ten 
"
907,SP1,"yeah for sure 
"
908,SP2,"Especially cause now like at least first semester I can't have any classes between three and five six three and six so like I have the that whole chunk of time likeI couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now I'm more flexible 
"
909,SP1,"that makes sense 
"
910,SP1,"Yeah cause of soccer sports yeah 
"
911,SP2,"Yeah but I'm still trying to have Wednesdays off it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week 
"
912,SP1,"it breaks up the week yeah that would be that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off 
"
913,SP2,"Yeah it's like you don't like Fridays off are nice but having one class on Fridays isn't the end of the world 
"
914,SP1,"no I have a rescitation that's not mandatory 
"
915,SP2,"Yeah 
"
916,SP1,"and like its 
"
917,SP2,"what for what class is it 
"
918,SP1,"for stats 
"
919,SP2,"Okay 
"
920,SP1,"Um I only have to show up if like when I pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance 
"
921,SP2,"mhm 
"
922,SP2,"Okay 
"
923,SP1,"Um so that helps 
"
924,SP2,"yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta 
"
925,SP1,"e yes except for stats which has three 
"
926,SP1,"Including rescitation 
"
927,SP2,"Okay 
"
928,SP2,"okay 
"
929,SP1,"But yeah it's nice 
"
930,SP2,"Yeah 
"
931,SP1,"One of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes 
"
932,SP2,"Uhhuh 
"
933,SP1,"And he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class I mean 
"
934,SP2,"Yeah 
"
935,SP1,"and Like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either 
"
936,SP2,"mhm 
"
937,SP1,"on Fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory 
"
938,SP2,"oh my gosh I'm worried for next semester cause I'm trying to take five classes 
"
939,SP1,"Same though 
"
940,SP2,"And then like most of them like if I take econ I'll have a rescitation 
"
941,SP1,"Okay 
"
942,SP2,"French two will have a rescitation 
"
943,SP1,"Yeah 
"
944,SP2,"I wanna take computer science 
"
945,SP1,"I do too but I don't know when I want to take it 
"
946,SP2,"I know 
"
947,SP1,"Like I want to take next semester but I feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it 
"
948,SP2,"I know 
"
949,SP1,"I don't it want to be a super busy clas I want to be able to like learn well for that class 
"
950,SP2,"Yeah 
"
951,SP2,"I've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all 
"
952,SP1,"well I don't know which is which 
"
953,SP2,"I know I need to figure it out too my one friend was like 
"
954,SP1,"Rate my professor 
"
955,SP2,"Yeah 
"
956,SP1,"work works really well 
"
957,SP2,"that is a good one 
"
958,SP2,"my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever 
"
959,SP1,"Yeah 
"
960,SP1,"That works 
"
961,SP2,"So we'll see 
"
962,SP1,"Yeah 
"
963,SP2,"Yeah 
"
964,SP1,"I don't know 
"
965,SP2,"I I just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was 
"
966,SP1,"Yeah that's how I feel 
"
967,SP2,"But 
"
968,SP1,"I took four pretty easy classes 
"
969,SP2,"Yeah me too 
"
970,SP1,"Or classes that don't have a lot of work 
"
971,SP2,"Yeah 
"
972,SP1,"so ah 
"
973,SP2,"Like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually 
"
974,SP1,"It;s reading heavy 
"
975,SP2,"it's reading heavy 
"
976,SP1,"which takes a long time but isn't that hard 
"
977,SP2,"Yeah and like I feel like my notes I'm so particular about how I take my notes that it takes even longer like 
"
978,SP1,"Do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read 
"
979,SP2,"So I like have tried everything like oh I used to go paragraph by paragraph which I know you're not supposed to do 
"
980,SP1,"mhm 
"
981,SP2,"but so then like this past time for chapter eight I would read through 
"
982,SP2,"All of eight point one like eight one A B C or whatever and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like I knew like I didn't have to re read each paragraph 
"
983,SP2,"I kinda knew what was going on 
"
984,SP1,"Okay 
"
985,SP2,"Um but that took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four 
"
986,SP1,"Really 
"
987,SP2,"Like I sat in Tisch from seven to eleven 
"
988,SP1,"Damn 
"
989,SP2,"doing psych [ ] 
"
990,SP1,"that's that's tough 
"
991,SP2,"And it's like it's such a it's like not a waste a time but like I could have been I feel like there's got to be a better way to do it 
"
992,SP1,"See I don't take notes at all when I read cause I'll just get distracted by it like I'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading 
"
993,SP2,"Yeah 
"
994,SP1,"and I won't learn as much from it 
"
995,SP2,"uh huh 
"
996,SP1,"I like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book 
"
997,SP2,"Yeah 
"
998,SP1,"and I'll go back and do those after 
"
999,SP1,"Just so I really master it 
"
1000,SP2,"Like the the quizzes or the 
"
1001,SP2,"
"
1002,SP1,"Yeah like a flash cards and quizzes I can go back and do those 
"
1003,SP2,"Yeah maybe I'll try that for chapter ten 
"
1004,SP1,"Yeah 
"
1005,SP2,"Like I just feel like if I get through chapter nine I'll be fine cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning 
"
1006,SP1,"yeah 
"
1007,SP1,"Yeah 
"
1008,SP2,"And then I'll just be able to like I can just review extra for it 
"
1009,SP1,"Yeah 
"
1010,SP2,"for test on Thursday 
"
1011,SP1,"That works it's the balance that I just take like really like really affected notes in class 
"
1012,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1013,SP1,"or I'll write down more than I necessarily 
"
1014,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1015,SP1,"but just so I have it 
"
1016,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1017,SP1,"Yeah 
"
1018,SP2,"I feel like 
"
1019,SP2,"My class notes could be better but it's also like I I feel like I don't pay as much attention in class because I know I have the reading to fall back on 
"
1020,SP1,"Okay yeah 
"
1021,SP2,"But like that's not good like I need to be paying attention in class but we'll see 
"
1022,SP1,"I get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture I'm like okay I I I g I not really getting right now just like go for further reading 
"
1023,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1024,SP1,"Um in the sometimes right the opposite world like I'll read it after like a lecture and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this do 
"
1025,SP1,"this doesn't make as much sense anymore 
"
1026,SP2,"mhm 
"
1027,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1028,SP1,"so but it is what it is I got 
"
1029,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1030,SP1,"It's really just studying for exams and learning the material 
"
1031,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1032,SP2,"exactly and like the I feel like this exam will be a little easier to study for 
"
1033,SP1,"well not that we've seen the exam questions 
"
1034,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1035,SP1,"from the first one we know how to do it 
"
1036,SP2,"Yes and like it's not as much it's not as specific I feel like the material 
"
1037,SP1,"Yeah 
"
1038,SP2,"it's more theories and like vague stuff 
"
1039,SP1,"A little more vague 
"
1040,SP2,"whereas like last time we had to know like all the different functions 
"
1041,SP1,"yeah 
"
1042,SP2,"and I was like lots of flash cards with that one 
"
1043,SP1,"I spend so much time just making flashcards and then I found out they had like the flash cards built in 
"
1044,SP2,"I know 
"
1045,SP1,"And I was like really did I just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason 
"
1046,SP2,"That's all my friends did the same thing and I just like I ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before like I took super diligent notes 
"
1047,SP2,"which made it easier 
"
1048,SP1,"mhm 
"
1049,SP2,"but I'm not doing that this time like I need to start studying tomorrow 
"
1050,SP1,"You know I promised myself I'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time 
"
1051,SP1,"Uh I didn't cause I just finished chapter eight so 
"
1052,SP2,"Yeah I finished chapter eight on Thursday 
"
1053,SP1,"I finished it 
"
1054,SP2,"Wednesday Thursday 
"
1055,SP1,"Yesterday so that was Friday 
"
1056,SP2,"Yeah 
"
1057,SP1,"Yeah 
"
1058,SP2,"And chapter nine and ten are apparently really long 
"
1059,SP1,"There's like five and six parts each 
"
1060,SP2,"Yeah and like the within the individual sections like they all scroll 
"
1061,SP1,"Yeah 
"
1062,SP2,"for a really long time and I'm just like I can't do this 
"
1063,SP1,"so much 
"
1064,SP2,"Do you ever watch the videos 
"
1065,SP1,"Yeah um if it seems like a short chapter 
"
1066,SP2,"Yeah 
"
