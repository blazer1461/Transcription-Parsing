"
SP1,"oh Yeah 
"
SP2,"cause then I 

"
SP1,"Yeah it's it is what it is 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"

"
SP2,"that's so funny 
"
SP1,"The scariest part is that I drove home like I drove home with only one contact in and don't even notice 
"
SP2,"That's so weir is there what's your prescription is it that 
"
SP1,"it's not that bad but I have like a really bad astigmatism 

"
SP2,"That's so i interesting 
"
SP1,"um Like I had nothing to cause the fear 
"
SP2,"Uh huh 
"
SP1,"I just had that fear 
"
SP2,"That's so weird 
"
SP1,"Uhm but then I was like fuck it I'll get contacts and that's definitely on video 
"
SP2,"Like the con it's like the conditioning or whatever 
"
SP1,"yeah finishing 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"Yeah 

"
SP1,"Yeah I should on that 
"
SP1,"my makes sense 
"
SP2,"I didn't want to wear the like goggles 
"
SP1,"see I just wore the my regular glasses when I played soccer when I was younger 
"
SP2,"uh huh 
"
SP1,"and they would always like fall off or I'd get hit in the face the ball 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"like I couldn't do headers like 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"I lost a whole point of the game 
"
SP2,"Exactly 
"
SP1,"Actually every sport I played a somehow at some point either break a pair of glasses or get hit in the face or like 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"something always went wrong 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"that's so f 
"
SP1,"except for cross country I never had problems with glasses in cross country 

"
SP1,"uh no I'm really good at getting hurt 
"
SP2,"No 

"
SP1,"I've injured like everything you can name a bone or place in my body I've hurt it 
"
SP2,"oh gosh really 
"
SP1,"It's yeah most likely doing something clumsy not even not even playing sports 
"
SP2,"That's f 
"
SP1,"Like I had three concussions in a month once 
"
SP2,"not good 
"
SP1,"I don't play any contact sports 
"
SP2,"what 

"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"Um my friend accidentally hti me in the head 
"
SP2,"oh gosh 
"
SP1,"So it was a small one the day I came back from that concussion someone hit me in the face with a basketball just like down like in the hall um the day I came back from that concussion I tripped and fell hit my head on a metal pole 
"
SP2,"That's such bad luck 
"
SP1,"Yeah it's fine I mean it's tough I couldn't have lost that much brain cells 
"
SP2,"My friend had one and she was out of school for like two months 
"
SP1,"Damn 
"
SP2,"it was terrible 
"
SP1,"Was a sports concussion though 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"Yeah so she was heading the she's a center back 
"
SP1,"That makes sense 
"
SP1,"Okay 
"
SP2,"And she was heading the ball and like it hit her too high up instead of on the forehead 
"
SP1,"that makes sense 
"
SP2,"And she lost s like it was during our junior junior year of high school and she couldn't play or she couldn't she stopped playing after she got the concussion cause she was too afraid and then she like it affected all her like ACTs SATs and like all of our classes 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"that's awful 
"
SP2,"She made it to Duke so I think she's doing okay 
"
SP1,"I think she's doing fine 
"
SP2,"Doesn't really matter 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"It worked out 

"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"I was out of school for like a week each 
"
SP2,"uh huh 
"
SP1,"um but the three in a row was what the problem was 
"
SP2,"Yeah that sets you back a lot 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP1,"it's okay it was my freshman year so I was I didn't have that much to do 
"
SP2,"oh 

"
SP2,"oh okay 
"
SP1,"um so now I'm in comedy 
"
SP2,"Cool 
"
SP1,"um which is I guess the third tier thing 
"
SP2,"Yeah that's so fun 
"
SP1,"so yeah 
"
SP2,"So cool 
"
SP1,"it's exciting 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"is it like new for you or have you done comedy before 
"
SP1,"I'm 
"
SP1,"I've done comedy before just it's been a while 
"
SP2,"uh huh 
"
SP1,"Like I did comedy when I was like thirteen 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"and like before I had any idea of what was actually funny 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"um So now it's different like I'm writing jokes like all the time 
"
SP2,"uh huh 
"
SP1,"now cause it's just finally I'll think of something funny and I'll write it down where as before I wouldn't think to write that down I would just like 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Think of something funny 
"
SP2,"That's so fun 
"
SP2,"that's so interesting 
"
SP1,"So 
"
SP1,"yeah even better is when I actually have the tell the jokes um because sometimes I'll just write down a a key word 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"like a like a word that if anyone read it like they would have no idea what I possibly mean by that 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"and then sometimes I'll forget what they mean 
"
SP2,"Uh huh 
"
SP1,"and it ruins the whole joke I'll just be like binoculars I don't know that joke is like 
"
SP2,"Is it like scripted when you do it or is it more 
"
SP1,"Some of it's scripted mostly not though it's mostly like I've written like part of a joke down and I'll like no matter how I tell it that's the joke is 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"I try to write as little as possible down so I can like consolidate space 
"
SP2,"uh huh 
"
SP1,"Um but other jokes have to be scripted because I can't be told otherwise 
"
SP2,"Yeah so like tonight when you go to the thing will you like have a set like something like prepared for it or is it more just like you'll go up there and 
"
SP1,"I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to do it memorized 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"um but I have a s I have a set prepared kind of 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"

"
SP1,"just yeah 

SP1,"the worst that could happen 
"
SP1,"Like is if you like hit your shin on something while you had shin splints 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP1,"then you could get a fracture cause your shins are weaker 

"
SP2,"oh was he in a top bunk or some 
"
SP1,"he just couldn't sleep 
"
SP1,"Yeah the other two of us aren't cause we put we put ours down 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"Which um means we have very little space in the room but we can sleep so 
"
SP2,"oh so he was was he lofted 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"so 
"
SP2,"So ours is like a lo we have the Hill dorms I've seen used 
"
SP1,"hills are huge 
"
SP2,"they're so big so the doubles are nor like p a Wonderful size 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"but ours is just like the exact same size but with three people living in it so it feels way smaller so like we have a lofted bed with she's all our stuff underneath and then we have our bunk bed 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"and I was the last of the rooms so on the top of the bunkbed 
"
SP1,"mmm 
"
SP2,"which kind of sucks but it's kinda cozy up there 
"
SP1,"that works 
"
SP2,"It just sucks cause I can't fold my laundry 
"
SP1,"oof 
"
SP2,"It's hard to do that 
"
SP1,"Yeah I don't I I feel like living in Hill has a lot of benefits 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP1,"like room size being one of them 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Like she probably don't feel like it's that forced of a triple like there's still plenty of space in your room 
"
SP2,"Yeah exactly like it's not like claustrophobic by any means 
"
SP1,"Like I can reach from the end of my bed to the end of my um roommates' bed 
"
SP2,"Like because the like 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"like cause the way it's set up at this point like it's not that far it's like three feet 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP2,"Did you get the third bed moved out 
"
SP1,"Not yet 
"
SP1,"Um because apparently you're supposed to pay for that 
"
SP2,"what 
"
SP1,"I thought that was silly but I don't know I'm still talking with res life about it 
"
SP2,"mhm That's ridic 
"
SP1,"They haven't gotten back to me 
"
SP2,"The guy who moved out should help you out with that 
"
SP1,"Yeah we'll figure it out um worst case scenario we don't move it out because we've been using his storage space 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"So 
"
SP2,"That's nice though 
"
SP1,"not a big deal 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Worst case scenario it's nothing happens so 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"wa we've been living fine in the first place 
"
SP2,"mhm It works out 
"
SP1,"Yeah the Hills dorms are just huge 
"
SP2,"I know 
"
SP1,"like my friend's in a single there and her room's bigger than mine 
"
SP2,"She's in a single 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"That's so nice 
"
SP1,"I wouldn't ever want to live in a single 
"
SP2,"I feel like singles I don't know I at least as a freshman I definitely wouldn't want to 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"But in some ways they're nice to just be like 
"
SP1,"It's nice to have the privacy but like you lose that already key scial output 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Yes 
"
SP1,"So 
"
SP2,"Like I feel like it's harder to make friends maybe 
"
SP1,"Yeah little bit 
"
SP2,"I don't know 
"
SP1,"Not a big deal 
"
SP2,"Yeah do you like uphill or d well you're down hill so do you eat at 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"I eat at Dewick mostly 
"
SP2,"you like dewick 
"
SP2,"I like Dewick 
"
SP1,"I'm sure you get Carm 
"
SP2,"I like Dewick so much better 
"
SP1,"Dewick is better better it's that's known 
"
SP2,"But Carm is just like so much more convenient 
"
SP1,"I think we should start calling Dewick just just Mcby just throw people off 
"
SP2,"Change it up 
"
SP1,"I mean it wouldn't change the person is just what it is 
"
SP2,"Yeah that's funny 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"people would be so confused 
"
SP1,"I got people call south um Harleston cause somebody else put money into it 
"
SP2,"I know 
"
SP1,"Um but most people still call it south 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Like I feel like Macphie's being left out 
"
SP2,"Everyone knows it's south 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Poor McPhee 
"
SP1,"Poor Macphie 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"no this is it one person or is it two 
"
SP1,"I think it's two people 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"like Dewick isn't the first name 
"
SP1,"um 
"
SP1,"No 
"
SP2,"It's Dewick 
"
SP1,"I don't think Dewick's a first name 
"
SP2,"they're both the last name 
"
SP1,"No my name is Dewick that's that'd be weird yeah 
"
SP2,"no 
"
SP2,"Dewick MacPhee I don't know 
"
SP1,"I don't know what it's d do 
"
SP2,"That's like there's so many Tisch buildings 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Like there's the library and then the gym 
"
SP1,"All the Tisch family's the Tisch family's ridiculously wealthy 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Like they own the they own the New York Giants 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"So like if they can own a sports team they can buy buildings at all these colleges 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Like almost every major college like has a Tisch building of some kind 
"
SP2,"I just don't get what the purpose of that is 
"
SP1,"Like investing their money into schools 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Higher education 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"I don't know that's what their that's what they believe in 
"
SP2,"that's Nice 
"
SP1,"Some people believe in investing in like more and more real estate to make more money they believe in investing in peoples' futures 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP2,"That's cool 
"
SP1,"By building Nice gyms 
"
SP2,"didn't think about it that way 
"
SP2,"The gyms 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"Keep the s Tufts students healthy 
"
SP1,"let's fight obesity let's put a giant hill right here 
"
SP1,"That'll help 
"
SP2,"So after you work out you have to walk up hill again 
"
SP1,"Might have killer calves 
"
SP2,"oh yeah 
"
SP1,"That's the whole goal 
"
SP2,"ugh 
"
SP1,"like if I had a set three goals for my entire time at Tufts the top three goals would all be to get killer calves 
"
SP2,"I feel like wa I have to every time I'm our field is down hill 
"
SP1,"Okay 
"
SP2,"so like everyday the walk from 
"
SP2,"Craft to Hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"And three days a week I have French right after practice 
"
SP1,"ooo 
"
SP2,"so either way I'm going like all the way to Olin 
"
SP1,"it's far 
"
SP2,"and it's just miserable 
"
SP2,"It's so far 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"especially now that it's cold it's pretty bad 
"
SP1,"but Being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class like you're at the same level as the classes like I have to walk uphill to every class 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"That's true 
"
SP1,"and have enough of a break time in between classes where I have to go back to my dorm to like do like do work and do things 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"And then go back to class so I'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum 
"
SP2,"Yeah where are most of your classes 
"
SP1,"um probably like they're in the academic quad mostly 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"But um it's nice I have one class in Granoff so 
"
SP2,"uhuh 
"
SP1,"I don't have to walk very far for that 
"
SP2,"That's nice yeah mine is I've one in Granoff too and then 
"
SP2,"I have one in Eaton so that's Kinda 
"
SP1,"Okay 
"
SP2,"I don't know what that counts as 
"
SP1,"think it's still the academic quad 
"
SP2,"Yeah and then Olin and then psych 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"So 
"
SP1,"Not bad 
"
SP2,"Not bad 
"
SP1,"it works out 
"
SP2,"Yeah I feel like if I were coming from Hil Oli like going to Olin and going to psych would be so easy 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"But like Eaton in Granoff doesn't really ap matter 
"
SP1,"Yeah Granoff's really easy for me 
"
SP2,"It would be the same from anywhere 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"cause it's like a one minute walk from Hodge 
"
SP2,"Yeah I have four classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
"
SP1,"Really 
"
SP2,"But then on I have no classes Wednesday and I only have one class on Monday and Friday so it's like a weird like I a pretty much always have a four day weekend 
"
SP1,"that works 
"
SP2,"Which is nice 
"
SP1,"Yeah I set up my classes differently I have two on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"And then I have one recitation on Friday 
"
SP2,"That's nice 
"
SP1,"um so it works out 
"
SP2,"that's really evenly broken up 
"
SP1,"Yeah and I thought that would be beneficial it's not 
"
SP2,"You don't like it 
"
SP1,"it just means I have work due every day 
"
SP2,"yeah that's what I like about having Wednesdays off 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"cause like I don't really have to do stuff Tuesday night 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"But like I can if I wanna get ahead and then I don't have to do anything Thursday nights 
"
SP1,"That works 
"
SP2,"Like I would do it again I think but I also end up wasting a lot of time cause my classes like if I don't I don't have class till six PM on Monday 
"
SP2,"so I end up just like sleeping in too late 
"
SP1,"Really 
"
SP2,"But you get you get you get 
"
SP1,"Yeah I mean I have class at nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays I hate that 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"And it's so early 
"
SP2,"I have yeah I have I have that too 
"
SP1,"And it's weird cause like I had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school 
"
SP2,"I have English 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP1,"Like I thought that was early and I think this is early even though it's later 
"
SP2,"Yeah like getting up at eight 
"
SP1,"I think it's 
"
SP2,"like I get up at eight for my nine ams 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"I feel like next semster I'm gonna try and go for everything after ten 
"
SP1,"yeah for sure 
"
SP2,"Especially cause now like at least first semester I can't have any classes between three and five six three and six so like I have the that whole chunk of time likeI couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now I'm more flexible 
"
SP1,"that makes sense 
"
SP1,"Yeah cause of soccer sports yeah 
"
SP2,"Yeah but I'm still trying to have Wednesdays off it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week 
"
SP1,"it breaks up the week yeah that would be that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off 
"
SP2,"Yeah it's like you don't like Fridays off are nice but having one class on Fridays isn't the end of the world 
"
SP1,"no I have a rescitation that's not mandatory 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"and like its 
"
SP2,"what for what class is it 
"
SP1,"for stats 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"Um I only have to show up if like when I pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"Um so that helps 
"
SP2,"yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta 
"
SP1,"e yes except for stats which has three 
"
SP1,"Including rescitation 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP2,"okay 
"
SP1,"But yeah it's nice 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"One of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes 
"
SP2,"Uhhuh 
"
SP1,"And he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class I mean 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"and Like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"

"

"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"I don't know 
"
SP2,"I I just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was 
"
SP1,"Yeah that's how I feel 
"
SP2,"But 
"
SP1,"I took four pretty easy classes 
"
SP2,"Yeah me too 
"
SP1,"Or classes that don't have a lot of work 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"so ah 
"
SP2,"Like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually 
"
SP1,"It;s reading heavy 
"
SP2,"it's reading heavy 
"
SP1,"which takes a long time but isn't that hard 
"
SP2,"Yeah and like I feel like my notes I'm so particular about how I take my notes that it takes even longer like 
"
SP1,"Do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read 
"
SP2,"So I like have tried everything like oh I used to go paragraph by paragraph which I know you're not supposed to do 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"but so then like this past time for chapter eight I would read through 
"
SP2,"All of eight point one like eight one A B C or whatever and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like I knew like I didn't have to re read each paragraph 
"
SP2,"I kinda knew what was going on 
"
SP1,"Okay 
"
SP2,"Um but that took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four 
"
SP1,"Really 
"
SP2,"Like I sat in Tisch from seven to eleven 
"
SP1,"Damn 
"
SP2,"doing psych [ ] 
"
SP1,"that's that's tough 
"
SP2,"And it's like it's such a it's like not a waste a time but like I could have been I feel like there's got to be a better way to do it 
"
SP1,"See I don't take notes at all when I read cause I'll just get distracted by it like I'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"and I won't learn as much from it 
"
SP2,"uh huh 
"
SP1,"I like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"and I'll go back and do those after 
"
SP1,"Just so I really master it 
"
SP2,"Like the the quizzes or the 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"Yeah like a flash cards and quizzes I can go back and do those 
"
SP2,"Yeah maybe I'll try that for chapter ten 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Like I just feel like if I get through chapter nine I'll be fine cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"And then I'll just be able to like I can just review extra for it 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"for test on Thursday 
"
SP1,"That works it's the balance that I just take like really like really affected notes in class 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"or I'll write down more than I necessarily 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"but just so I have it 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"I feel like 
"
SP2,"My class notes could be better but it's also like I I feel like I don't pay as much attention in class because I know I have the reading to fall back on 
"
SP1,"Okay yeah 
"
SP2,"But like that's not good like I need to be paying attention in class but we'll see 
"
SP1,"I get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture I'm like okay I I I g I not really getting right now just like go for further reading 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Um in the sometimes right the opposite world like I'll read it after like a lecture and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this do 
"
SP1,"this doesn't make as much sense anymore 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"so but it is what it is I got 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"It's really just studying for exams and learning the material 

SP2,"exactly and like the I feel like this exam will be a little easier to study for 
"
SP1,"well not that we've seen the exam questions 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"from the first one we know how to do it 
"
SP2,"Yes and like it's not as much it's not as specific I feel like the material 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"it's more theories and like vague stuff 
"
SP1,"A little more vague 
"
SP2,"whereas like last time we had to know like all the different functions 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"and I was like lots of flash cards with that one 
"
SP1,"I spend so much time just making flashcards and then I found out they had like the flash cards built in 
"
SP2,"I know 
"
SP1,"And I was like really did I just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason 
"
SP2,"That's all my friends did the same thing and I just like I ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before like I took super diligent notes 
"
SP2,"which made it easier 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"but I'm not doing that this time like I need to start studying tomorrow 
"
SP1,"You know I promised myself I'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time 
