"
764,SP2,"Yeah I mean the thing is like I am aware of the fact that m ost might Russian is very casual and conversational and I can read and all that but actual like writing compositions that are formal and whatever I I don't have the schools but that's I feel like I would probably struggle in hig h level Russian because because you have to do everything I can just 
"
765,SP1,"Yeah 

"
776,SP2,"hm 
"
777,SP1,"um so English is like like really his best like which is first l anguage um and Spanish you very conversational but he's like it's funny because we have like four five kids to take Spanish in the suite and they all like column out so often on my grammar and like 
"
778,SP2,"hm 
"
779,SP2,"So funny 
"
780,SP1,"Spelling mistakes and stuff 
"
781,SP2,"Things about learning a language um like as a just in your family or whate ver it's really interesting because conversation only you are much more li kely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like I have that experience with French like when I talk to people who knew French slang and things like that like it's almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and I feel like it's just it's not as interesting like verses writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is like impossible but then people were formally educated can't write mess 
"
782,SP1,"Yeah 
"
783,SP2,"so I don't know 
"
784,SP2,"What else whatever's more useful you know 
"
785,SP1,"Yeah but like 
"
786,SP1,"I feel like it's more of a function of like if you learn it conversational you learn vocab and then you learn grammar 
"
787,SP2,"I yeah 
"
788,SP1,"Like you learn those the same time and 
"
789,SP2,"Grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost because it's like t rial and error 

"
791,SP1,"you can just pick up on it yeah 
"
792,SP2,"yeah yeah yeah 
"
793,SP1,"but when you learn to formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like 
"
794,SP2,"Um 
"
795,SP1,"At least in my fears was no actual practice so without like immersion is practice and as such like vocab kinda just is fleeting like you learn it for months to get pass a tough many move on 
"
796,SP2,"mhm 
"
797,SP2,"It's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way I think  languages are more like gradual that way I feel like learning them formally it's almost Counterproductive 

798,SP1,"it sucks I hate languages 
"
799,SP2,"yeah 
