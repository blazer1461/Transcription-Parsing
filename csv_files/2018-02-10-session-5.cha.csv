1,SP2,"Okay s so
"
2,SP1,"This is weird
"
3,SP2,"Yep
"
4,SP1,"It's like a two way mirror but only a one way mirror Or
"
5,SP2,"Yeah
"
6,SP1,"Or all way mirror I don't know not really mirror
"
7,SP2,"Or is mirror the reality
"
8,SP2,"question mark
"
9,SP1,"Isn't it by definition a reflection of reality
"
10,SP2,"Whatever you whatever you think man
"
11,SP1,"If you could see through it would it would just be a no way mirror right a zero way mirror
"
12,SP2,"I guess yeah
"
13,SP2,"Or a one
"
14,SP1,"Are one way mirrors the one that you can see through
"
15,SP1,"A from one side but not the other side
"
16,SP2,"This is an existential conversation we're having
"
17,SP1,"Yeah I feel like it probably would cause a twoway mirror would be reflective on both sides and you wouldn't be able to see much through it
"
18,SP2,"astute
"
19,SP2,"Astute sir
"
20,SP1,"This room is weird I feel like I'm in a padded room
"
21,SP2,"I feel like you're in front of a green screen and I should be seeing like some kind of like
"
22,SP1,"Like some nice visuals in the back
"
23,SP2,"Interesting background
"
24,SP2,"yeah there personal question for you if you could be in front of any green screen background what would it be
"
25,SP1,"I quite like the green in the background green's my favorite color I think I' m just happy with this
"
26,SP2,"Man of simplicity
"
27,SP1,"What would you
"
28,SP2,"wow
"
29,SP1,"Would you prefer to be in front of fake backgrounds
"
30,SP2,"well see
"
31,SP2,"Neon green disturbs me
"
32,SP1,"We can't be friends then
"
33,SP2,"Fine that's fine I don't
"
34,SP1,"Neon green is like the third best green
"
35,SP2,"No
"
36,SP1,"Yeah absolutely
"
37,SP2,"Muted colors are always the most elegant what are you talking about
"
38,SP1,"Muted colors like
"
39,SP1,"What what's a muted what would youeven consider a muted color
"
40,SP2,"Like
"
41,SP2,"like forest green is an acceptable green because it's not like in your face you know it's like a polite green that asks you how are you and doesn't like punch you in the face like neon green does
"
42,SP1,"On one hand I agree because forest green is obviously the best green
"
43,SP2,"Of course you agree because I'm always right
"
44,SP1,"I I would say it's more that forest green is just the best green
"
45,SP2,"Neon green sucks
"
46,SP1,"That being said that being said
"
47,SP1,"neon green is one of the best greens but it's not the best but it's it's close
"
48,SP2,"No you're wrong
"
49,SP2,"You're wrong
"
50,SP1,"The tree wait do you have a tree too
"
51,SP2,"Yes I think so if you count tha yeah that's a tree
"
52,SP1,"Yeah we have like mirror rooms kinda weird there's even a weird yellow paper in the bottom corner on both
"
53,SP1,"Interesting
"
54,SP2,"Oh I think they meant for it to be like this to seem like um okay
"
55,SP1,"It's like a mirror except for it's you and not me in the mirror
"
56,SP2,"Yup
"
57,SP1,"That's weird
"
58,SP2,"It's kinda like you're talking to yourself but you're hallucinating it's me
"
59,SP1,"e
"
60,SP2,"Mhm
"
61,SP1,"I like the the green uh on the leaves though is like the best green
"
62,SP2,"Very observant What kind of shade is that what would you call that
"
63,SP1,"Leaf green
"
64,SP1,"Very descriptive as well
"
65,SP2,"You should you should be an artist like you're just the creativity is just like oozing today
"
66,SP1,"Yeah
"
67,SP1,"You know when you're stuck in a in a large pad box it's hard to be creative
"
68,SP2,"I yeah I can understand the pain
"
69,SP1,"This is crazy are you going to Winter Ball tonight
"
70,SP2,"I don't know I was thinking about it why
"
71,SP1,"I am also thinking about it but I probably
"
72,SP1,"I don't think I'm gonna go
"
73,SP2,"Yeah I mean
"
74,SP1,"Because it's ten dollars and that's a lot of dollars but on the other hand like
"
75,SP2,"Typical student huh
"
76,SP1,"Yeah but like on the other hand like it's an experience and like you shouldn't miss out on experiences if you have the choice I feel like
"
77,SP2,"That's true
"
78,SP2,"but then some experiences are better than others and I don't know a the quality of this experience because I've heard that it's less of a dance and more of a concert and that doesn't sound very
"
79,SP2,"Enticing
"
80,SP1,"Appealing
"
81,SP1,"Yeah I feel that
"
82,SP2,"Dancing is fun though
"
83,SP1,"I can't say I feel that
"
84,SP2,"We'll convert you there's everyone can dance I don't like pe people who are like oh I can't d everyone can dance
"
85,SP1,"I can't dance
"
86,SP2,"Yes you can

90,SP2,"Next time there's a party we'll fix this
"
91,SP1,"Okay I can dance I can dance but I can't dance well like at all
"
92,SP2,"Baloney please
"
93,SP1,"Although you made a good point like it might be an experience but it's not necessarily the best experience for my night
"
94,SP2,"There we go you know what's a better experience dancing
"
95,SP1,"Yeah but dancing will be included in that experience so I feel like
"
96,SP2,"No Concert dancing is different that's like swaying and being boring that's not
"
97,SP1,"Yeah
"
98,SP1,"That's not dancing
"
99,SP2,"It doesn't count
"
100,SP1,"I can't dance then
"
101,SP2,"Then I we'll fix it that's fine
"
102,SP1,"What if I'm allergic
"
103,SP2,"You can't be allergic to dancing what

116,SP2,"m muahaha
"
117,SP1,"whatever the aller what would you call it if you give someone what they're allergic to is it poisoning  yeah probably not poisoning
"
118,SP2,"What would we call that reaction hyper motor ptosis
"
119,SP1,"Hyper motor ptosis
"
120,SP2,"Boom
"
121,SP1,"I like the pto
"
122,SP2,"Thank you
"
123,SP1,"That's the best part of it the pto

"
134,SP2,"No it's not real
"
135,SP2,"Course it's not real
"
136,SP1,"In context it could have been real but
"
137,SP2,"Someone you don't know everything Everything can be real
"
138,SP1,"Yeah I Yeah I'd
"
139,SP1,"Well I mean I'm pretty sure that like your teeth can't just liquify but like other than that
"
140,SP2,"What do you know You're not a doctor
"
141,SP2,"You have you have no knowledge the world
"
142,SP1,"Yeah you're right

"
149,SP1,"my dad always used to say

150,SP1,"I I I'm always right except for the one time I thought I was wrong but I was actually right
"
151,SP2,"I know! Oh my god I remember that quote I don't know where I saw that too but it was from somewhere
"
152,SP1,"Yeah My dad definitely didn't make that up so we got it from somewhere for sure
"
153,SP2,"Like a book or something
"
154,SP2,"Yeah
"
155,SP1,"But like you know you can never trace dad wisdom
"
156,SP2,"My dad likes reciting quotes too but up until the age of probably fifteen I just wholeheartedly believed that he made all of those up and then I was gravely disappointed
"
157,SP1,"Yeah the first time that you see a dad joke elsewhere like not from your dad you're just like I've been cheated
"
158,SP1,"I've been lied to
"
159,SP2,"It's
"
160,SP2,"it's interesting cause I mean Russian dads are different they're they don't make dad jokes they're like
"
161,SP2,"Melancholy and at times very serious but
"
162,SP1,"Russian dads
"
163,SP2,"They have their moments
"
164,SP1,"I've never met a Russian dad or like a Russian person
"
165,SP2,"I know it's it's an ex well hi but it's an experience
"
166,SP1,"hi

167,SP2,"Yeah it's interesting
"
168,SP1,"I think there are probably
"
169,SP1,"There are probably like
"
170,SP1,"Maybe three or four like
"
171,SP1,"Like primarily Russian in descent families from like my town

"
245,SP2,"Aw

"
262,SP1,"that's crazy
"
263,SP2,"What happened a year later two years later
"
264,SP1,"That's crazy
"
265,SP2,"yeah
"
266,SP1,"That's so
"
267,SP2,"Also our group our grandparent like are my two grandfathers actually knew each other before that because they went to school together

275,SP2,"I'm just cooler than you I'm sorry
"
276,SP1,"Yeah like evidently
"
277,SP2,"I I know it's yeah I know it's a di sappointment but yeah
"
278,SP1,"I was your family as
"
279,SP2,"Now you know
"
280,SP2,"No Verne
"
281,SP1,"That wasn't even a shot that was he was shot
"
282,SP2,"burn shots fi But I I'm so offended I don't even
"
283,SP1,"I don't even know how to
"
284,SP2,"I'm having too many feelings
"
285,SP1,"If you go to take a break and um crash
"
286,SP2,"yeah
"
287,SP1,"I would feel but no I wouldn't feel but I mean it's all it that well that i t wasn't even meant that way at all
"
288,SP2,"you wouldn't even feel ba
"
289,SP2,"Do you feel while
"
290,SP1,"Well I mean if you're crying out I have likea
"
291,SP2,"Good an ice cold heart
"
292,SP2,"Could just
"
293,SP1,"There's like a baseline of like sadness like empathy maybe but
"
294,SP2,"Well
"
295,SP1,"I don't think it's
"
296,SP1,"deserves so
"
297,SP2,"Empathy is very important and it's a defining factor in emotional intelligence did you know that
"
298,SP1,"last night we were watching planet earth and there were these turtles
"
299,SP1,"Like I can't comprehend intuition
"
300,SP2,"What do you mean
"
301,SP2,"Like
"
302,SP2,"in general
"
303,SP1,"Yeah because like
"
304,SP2,"It's like a sixth sense it's just a feeling you get
"
305,SP1,"Yeah but where does that come from
"
306,SP2,"Lives you know
"
307,SP1,"How how does like a
"
308,SP2,"I think we I feel like we develop it because we learn a lot about social interactions and we kind of pick um
"
309,SP1,"Yeah but how do like baby turtles know to go towards the light
"
310,SP2,"Well they're biologically programmed I would think there's certain cells in t he brain
"
311,SP1,"But what is the biological programming like this is where I'm confu sed
"
312,SP2,"What we come we're kind of talking about that in psych nine a little b it like the brain like brain plasticity and how like the brain adapts to certain situations I guess
"
313,SP1,"the one lost
"
314,SP2,"throughout the evolution
"
315,SP1,"But
"
316,SP1,"but it's saying that it can become like pre that they can come for it out did
"
317,SP2,"Yeah
"
318,SP1,"That's crazy
"
319,SP2,"A lot of animal do that we're some of the only
"
320,SP1,"So should not be like evidence for like physical
"
321,SP2,"Like
"
322,SP1,"Like there's a physical
"
323,SP1,"Part of like memory
"
324,SP2,"Yeah yeah the brain is constantly like reconfiguring itself throughout the evolution of the species like I feel like we're the only ones that have to develop like after were born like a lot of animals just come pre programm ed already but some
"
325,SP1,"Yeah but I feel like I like all animals word
"
326,SP2,"Thanks
"
327,SP1,"I don't think learning is outside of the room
"
328,SP2,"No no they demonstrate learning but I feel like we are the only ones t hat are were born the most help I mean if you think about it like  a baby zebra or something will start walking within like a day to and we're like just vegetated dental work
"
329,SP1,"Yeah
"
330,SP2,"Two and a half so
"
331,SP1,"I guess I guess animals are like
"
332,SP1,"Protected by their mothers are much more hopeless
"
333,SP1,"general I I guess I w ould agree with that
"
334,SP2,"yeah that's true where were very spoiled species
"
335,SP1,"Because like animals like out I was just thinking like if you're born alone you how to out of your eco alone you just know
"
336,SP1,"But you need to go towards the water not in the full moon and stuff like that like
"
337,SP2,"Yeah that's true
"
338,SP2,"Although some animals were demonstrated to sh demonstrate um they show altruism so like if their kid is in some kind of danger they will sacrifice themse lves finals do that
"
339,SP1,"Yeah I feel like altruism is like a pretty explainable
"
340,SP1,"thing
"
341,SP2,"Yeah
"
342,SP1,"Are I'm like
"
343,SP2,"like an imprinting and stuff like that
"
344,SP1,"yeah definitely I don't like I must not fully understand the like
"
345,SP1,"The controversy around um
"
346,SP1,"Whatever just talking about which I have forgotten
"
347,SP2,"Intuition altruism imprinting
"
348,SP1,"Altruism
"
349,SP1,"altruism
"
350,SP2,"Okay
"
351,SP1,"I feel like I don't understand the controversy around alters my feel like it's pretty explainable like flick fitness Street
"
352,SP2,"I guess yeah I mean I don't know it's kind of like if you are on the team of survival of the fittest then it's kinda strange that a fit mother would for example sacrifice herself to protect her sickly child like that seems kind of counter intuitive but then
"
353,SP1,"I think sickly it might be a defining characteristic which would make altruism not really as important
"
354,SP1,"I I think I feel like altruism makes sense a lot if you View the goal as passing on your genes
"
355,SP2,"Why what do you mean
"
356,SP1,"if your kids are like
"
357,SP2,"Meaning if the kids are healthy and they're being in
"
358,SP1,"If you're yeah so it's in your best interest to keep your it's much easier to keep a kid healthy than it is to literally become pregnant and then like have the kid again
"
359,SP2,"okay
"
360,SP2,"Gotcha
"
361,SP2,"Okay
"

"
747,SP1,"A friend
"
748,SP2,"What about French culture
"
749,SP1,"One of the kids must read from Honduras and like it's funny because even though Honduras obviously the Spanish speaking country like primarily he um up like pro he went by private schools are taught English
"
750,SP2,"hm
"
751,SP1,"um so English is like like really his best like which is first l anguage um and Spanish you very conversational but he's like it's funny because we have like four five kids to take Spanish in the suite and they all like column out so often on my grammar and like
"
752,SP2,"hm
"
753,SP2,"So funny
"
754,SP1,"Spelling mistakes and stuff
"
755,SP2,"Things about learning a language um like as a just in your family or whate ver it's really interesting because conversation only you are much more li kely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like I have that experience with French like when I talk to people who knew French slang and things like that like it's almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and I feel like it's just it's not as interesting like verses writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is like impossible but then people were formally educated can't write mess
"
756,SP1,"Yeah
"
757,SP2,"so I don't know
"
758,SP2,"What else whatever's more useful you know
"
759,SP1,"Yeah but like
"
760,SP1,"I feel like it's more of a function of like if you learn it conversational you learn vocab and then you learn grammar
"
761,SP2,"I yeah
"
762,SP1,"Like you learn those the same time and
"
763,SP2,"Grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost because it's like t rial and error

"
765,SP1,"you can just pick up on it yeah
"
766,SP2,"yeah yeah yeah
"
767,SP1,"but when you learn to formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like
"
768,SP2,"Um
"
769,SP1,"At least in my fears was no actual practice so without like immersion is practice and as such like vocab kinda just is fleeting like you learn it for months to get pass a tough many move on
"
770,SP2,"mhm
"
771,SP2,"It's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way I think  languages are more like gradual that way I feel like learning them formally it's almost Counterproductive

772,SP1,"it sucks I hate languages
