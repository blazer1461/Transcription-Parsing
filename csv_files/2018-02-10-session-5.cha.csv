"
SP2,"Whatever you whatever you think man 
"
SP1,"If you could see through it would it would just be a no way mirror right a zero way mirror 
"
SP2,"I guess yeah 
"
SP2,"Or a one 
"
SP1,"Are one way mirrors the one that you can see through 
"
SP1,"
"
SP1,"A from one side but not the other side 
"
SP2,"This is an existential conversation we're having 

"
SP2,"astute 
"
SP2,"Astute sir 
"

"
SP1,"On one hand I agree because forest green is obviously the best green 
"
SP2,"Of course you agree because I'm always right 
"
SP1,"I I would say it's more that forest green is just the best green 
"
SP2,"Neon green sucks 

"
SP2,"Good an ice cold heart 
"
SP2,"Could just 
"
SP1,"There's like a baseline of like sadness like empathy maybe but 
"
SP2,"Well 
"
SP1,"I don't think it's 
"
SP1,"deserves so 
"
SP2,"Empathy is very important and it's a defining factor in emotional intelligence did you know that 
"
SP1,"last night we were watching planet earth and there were these turtles 
"
SP1,"Like I can't comprehend intuition 
"
SP2,"What do you mean 
"
SP2,"
"
SP2,"Like 
"
SP2,"in general 
"
SP1,"Yeah because like 
"
SP2,"It's like a sixth sense it's just a feeling you get 
"
SP1,"Yeah but where does that come from 
"
SP2,"Lives you know 
"
SP1,"How how does like a 
"
SP2,"I think we I feel like we develop it because we learn a lot about social interactions and we kind of pick um 
"
SP1,"Yeah but how do like baby turtles know to go towards the light 
"
SP2,"Well they're biologically programmed I would think there's certain cells in t he brain 
"
SP1,"But what is the biological programming like this is where I'm confu sed 
"
SP2,"What we come we're kind of talking about that in psych nine a little b it like the brain like brain plasticity and how like the brain adapts to certain situations I guess 
"
SP1,"the one lost 
"
SP2,"throughout the evolution 
"
SP1,"But 
"
SP1,"but it's saying that it can become like pre that they can come for it out did 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"That's crazy 
"
SP2,"A lot of animal do that we're some of the only 
"
SP1,"So should not be like evidence for like physical 
"
SP2,"Like 
"
SP1,"Like there's a physical 
"
SP1,"Part of like memory 
"
SP2,"Yeah yeah the brain is constantly like reconfiguring itself throughout the evolution of the species like I feel like we're the only ones that have to develop like after were born like a lot of animals just come pre programm ed already but some 
"
SP1,"Yeah but I feel like I like all animals word 
"
SP2,"Thanks 
"
SP1,"I don't think learning is outside of the room 
"
SP2,"No no they demonstrate learning but I feel like we are the only ones t hat are were born the most help I mean if you think about it like  a baby zebra or something will start walking within like a day to and we're like just vegetated dental work 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Two and a half so 
"
SP1,"I guess I guess animals are like 
"
SP1,"Protected by their mothers are much more hopeless 
"
SP1,"general I I guess I w ould agree with that 
"
SP2,"yeah that's true where were very spoiled species 
"
SP1,"Because like animals like out I was just thinking like if you're born alone you how to out of your eco alone you just know 
"
SP1,"But you need to go towards the water not in the full moon and stuff like that like 
"
SP2,"Yeah that's true 
"
SP2,"Although some animals were demonstrated to sh demonstrate um they show altruism so like if their kid is in some kind of danger they will sacrifice themse lves finals do that 
"
SP1,"Yeah I feel like altruism is like a pretty explainable 
"
SP1,"thing 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Are I'm like 
"
SP2,"like an imprinting and stuff like that 
"
SP1,"yeah definitely I don't like I must not fully understand the like 
"
SP1,"The controversy around um 
"
SP1,"Whatever just talking about which I have forgotten 
"
SP2,"Intuition altruism imprinting 
"
SP1,"Altruism 
"
SP1,"
"
SP1,"altruism 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"I feel like I don't understand the controversy around alters my feel like it's pretty explainable like flick fitness Street 
"
SP2,"I guess yeah I mean I don't know it's kind of like if you are on the team of survival of the fittest then it's kinda strange that a fit mother would for example sacrifice herself to protect her sickly child like that seems kind of counter intuitive but then 
"
SP1,"I think sickly it might be a defining characteristic which would make altruism not really as important 
"
SP1,"I I think I feel like altruism makes sense a lot if you View the goal as passing on your genes 
"
SP2,"Why what do you mean 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"if your kids are like 
"
SP2,"Meaning if the kids are healthy and they're being in 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"If you're yeah so it's in your best interest to keep your it's much easier to keep a kid healthy than it is to literally become pregnant and then like have the kid again 
"
SP2,"okay 
"
SP2,"Gotcha 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"So it's like within your it's in your best interest to keep alive I feel like I 
"
SP2,"I'll give to 
"
SP2,"That's true that makes sense 
"
SP1,"I don't know maybe it's too like utilitarian 
"
SP2,"Like it to 
"
SP1,"Where to look at it I don't know 
"
SP2,"At the end world is brutal I mean there's no democracy over there it's just like you sick by 
"
SP1,"Right 
"
SP2,"see ya 
"
SP1,"Yeah like that's 
"
SP2,"So no health care for the animals 
"
SP1,"It 
"
SP1,"it's so human to like project and like after more five s tuff 
"
SP2,"Yeah for sure 
"
SP1,"And just like 
"
SP1,"give it like No personify things but 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"In reality like things don't care there's no mercy is no empathy like 
"
SP2,"Nope 
"
SP2,"My role I mean I we were learning a lot about that and psych twenty last s emester about um self reference insult generation and things like you're more l ikely to remember things anymore like a to understand things if you do them your self and you somehow 

"
SP2,"that too 
"
SP2,"Well language are you taking for your credits 
"
SP1,"I took Latin three semesters 

"
SP2,"That's really cool 
"
SP1,"Um 
"
SP1,"like I'm I did a what I did very little of the translati on homework but like some kids I know like are actually fluent in Latin it 's crazy 
"
SP2,"Supposed to do your homework Sir it's not very studious 
"
SP1,"It wasn't created 
"
SP1,"So no interactive 
"
SP2,"Yeah I still have to take my friend culture class it'll be done they almost my credits from high school 
"
SP1,"Lucky 
"
SP2,"I really should a taken that Russian placement exam that would probabl y make things easier for pre 
"
SP1,"If you would well you can in order place out of language yo u can do to languages to twelve like a three class level 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP1,"or you could do o ne language to like anywhere from three to six and then like culture class and stuff 
"
SP2,"Gotcha 
"
SP1,"But if you'd place into like Russian for and French for you woul d have been completed on with your requirement 
"
SP2,"Yeah I mean the thing is like I am aware of the fact that m ost might Russian is very casual and conversational and I can read and all that but actual like writing compositions that are formal and whatever I I don't have the schools but that's I feel like I would probably struggle in hig h level Russian because because you have to do everything I can just 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"You know make jokes whatever like 
"
SP1,"We could take like Russian three though and then just do one year rush one semester of Russian be done but whatever 
"
SP2,"Interact 
"
SP1,"It's too late 
"
SP2,"Yeah I mean it's fine I I plot practicing of Russian with my family and all that so 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"I'll just 
"
SP1,"A friend 
"
SP2,"What about French culture 
"
SP1,"One of the kids must read from Honduras and like it's funny because even though Honduras obviously the Spanish speaking country like primarily he um up like pro he went by private schools are taught English 
"
SP2,"hm 
"
SP1,"um so English is like like really his best like which is first l anguage um and Spanish you very conversational but he's like it's funny because we have like four five kids to take Spanish in the suite and they all like column out so often on my grammar and like 
"
SP2,"hm 
"
SP2,"So funny 
"
SP1,"Spelling mistakes and stuff 
"
SP2,"Things about learning a language um like as a just in your family or whate ver it's really interesting because conversation only you are much more li kely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like I have that experience with French like when I talk to people who knew French slang and things like that like it's almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and I feel like it's just it's not as interesting like verses writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is like impossible but then people were formally educated can't write mess 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"so I don't know 
"
SP2,"What else whatever's more useful you know 
"
SP1,"Yeah but like 
"
SP1,"I feel like it's more of a function of like if you learn it conversational you learn vocab and then you learn grammar 
"
SP2,"I yeah 
"
SP1,"Like you learn those the same time and 
"
SP2,"Grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost because it's like t rial and error 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"you can just pick up on it yeah 
"
SP2,"yeah yeah yeah 
"
SP1,"but when you learn to formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like 
"
SP2,"Um 
"
SP1,"At least in my fears was no actual practice so without like immersion is practice and as such like vocab kinda just is fleeting like you learn it for months to get pass a tough many move on 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP2,"It's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way I think  languages are more like gradual that way I feel like learning them formally it's almost Counterproductive 
"
SP1,"it sucks I hate languages 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"a healing which is the only time I would ever like I would be down to learn another language but I would only do it for merch ant 
"
SP2,"Russian 
"
SP1,"I wouldn't do it 
"
SP2,"Russian learn Russian 
