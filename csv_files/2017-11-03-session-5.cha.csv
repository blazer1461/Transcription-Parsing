"
279,SP2,"Really
"
280,SP1,"Yes

281,SP2,"I wanted to like try to rough it but I feel like the
"
282,SP1,"The right
"
283,SP2,"Parents would be
"
284,SP1,"Then for the problem of sleep there's a lot of work
"
285,SP2,"Yeah
"
286,SP1,"To rough it was like you have to train them like it was nice to be it already soccer for so you if you know the rules but was

"
293,SP1,"Twenty twenty five thirty dollars a game
"
294,SP2,"that's pretty good
"
295,SP1,"But they were like one hour games
"
296,SP2,"Oh so yeah that's pretty good
"
297,SP1,"or  yeah

306,SP1,"So you are playing for the team and those those yeah
"
307,SP2,"Yeah
"
308,SP2,"Like the reps would make bank considering how long the game was but they'd show up five minutes before and then leave right after they got there paying they'd make like

310,SP2,"Fifty dollar an hour type of thing that's like
"
311,SP2,"It's a very good pen her that however ever wondered how much like FIFA refs make

312,SP1,"That is the question but I feel like
"
313,SP2,"So it isn't a lot but it's a good amount

"
497,SP2,"Yeah
"
498,SP1,"Like now you have to register for classes only got of the I wish I'd because like everything was like for this major take this this major date this and by then
"
499,SP2,"Yeah
"
500,SP1,"You're already at like five foot five credits
"
501,SP2,"Did you have your major like decided by the time you
"
502,SP1,"When I came I was like ninety five percent by a closer
"
503,SP2,"Yeah
"
504,SP1,"And then psychology just came after last semester ting of social psych and it's like
"
505,SP2,"Yeah
"
506,SP1,"Who only look into this and like I saw was relatively easy to like finish it like a I
"
507,SP1,"Right now after next semester I know I only have to take five more classes for that major
"
508,SP2,"Yeah
"
509,SP1,"And then six more classes the other major so that's eleven classes over four semesters versus like which is not that much um did
"
510,SP2,"Yeah
"
511,SP1,"For for
"
512,SP1,"No five five so that's sixteen over four semesters no it's going down
"

"
514,SP1,"To level all the for graduate and so it's a vehicle that's one open
"
515,SP2,"Yeah
"
516,SP1,"To survive this semester the system pre brutal
"
517,SP2,"Yeah you get through this year based on the home stretch after awhile
"
518,SP1,"Yeah what's a good crazy
"
519,SP2,"Work terms
"
520,SP2,"Down
"
521,SP2,"How did you decide so early what you want no knew what you wanted to do
"
522,SP1,"We
"
523,SP1,"Yes this pre med came pretty easy to sleep through courses my mom dad's a doctor just like medical events in the family so like that I came pretty easy and like from there also to see what other majors related to a the bios to like
"
524,SP1,"Broad consequence up to like a fit like that's like an easier siding chemistries like like a lot of really specifics for feel like bio chem is like it's definitely more chemistry than bio but like it introduces enough file just
"
525,SP1,"That like I can still enjoy that aspect of bio that like that
"
526,SP2,"Yeah good Max
"
527,SP1,"I enjoy yeah exactly what's that mean um what more lean towards him to say like seventy chemistry and then thirty bio
"
528,SP1,"That's like is like
"
529,SP2,"There
"
530,SP1,"Hello more fun for me
"
531,SP2,"Yeah did you take psych wonder

"
535,SP2,"Yeah
"
536,SP1,"We could give to the credit unlike in high school I don't know why full of like an
"
537,SP1,"I just memorize everything so well
"
538,SP2,"Yeah
"
539,SP1,"So like even last semester they'll be like a year removed from my school
"
540,SP1,"I don't say that much because I still remembered everything
"
541,SP2,"Down
"
542,SP1,"So like it's still health like for chem those the same like the first semester was absolutely no mean yeah I study but like not as much some study now
"
543,SP2,"Yeah
"
544,SP1,"Cuz like this is like I feel like this semester is the first one let it was a completely new material
"
545,SP2,"Yeah
"
546,SP1,"This is last semester I suffer Arabic which I didn't know but up
"
547,SP1,"The other two at least I have like the basis of something

563,SP2,"Yeah
"
564,SP1,"About math for you
"
565,SP2,"Well now I
"
566,SP2,"I took like my first hard math class I thing
"
567,SP1,"All
"
568,SP2,"Junior high school
"
569,SP1,"What was the
"
570,SP2,"Is basically like intro to a be
"
571,SP1,"Oh intro to ab
"
572,SP2,"Yeah which are my high school is kind of weird for they had like
"
573,SP1,"Do
"
574,SP1,"They tried to speed you along if they saw you were a little bit I took geometry honors or something freshman year and they said okay wellwe're gonna put you like in this weird
"
575,SP2,"Sick
"
576,SP2,"Uh
"
577,SP1,"Algebra two class a little bit higher so you can go up to AB or something
"
578,SP2,"Yeah I took BC in junior year
"
579,SP1,"Yeah damn
"
580,SP1,"Yeah I heard BC is mucheasier compared to calc two in college
"
581,SP2,"It's
"
582,SP2,"Much easier
"
583,SP1,"Yeah like taking two in high school is easier compared to
"
584,SP2,"Yeah no I feel like
"
585,SP1,"Two here
"
586,SP2,"Everything
"
587,SP2,"I mean yeah
"
588,SP1,"Yeah I mean speed kinda plays a factor too I'm sure that makes it harder justby
"
589,SP2,"Exactly
"
590,SP1,"Like
"
591,SP1,"Being therebut
"
592,SP2,"No I I w I really ex when I first came to college I really expected the speed to be a lot more of a factor you know I mean like
"
593,SP1,"Yeah
"
594,SP2,"Was like oh I have I have to learn all I did
"
595,SP1,"in a year
"
596,SP2,"I'm learning a year in like a few months but like in reality you don't learn that much
"
597,SP2,"Yeah
"
598,SP1,"Like
"
599,SP2,"Yeah
"
600,SP1,"Lake in the high if you to like chemistry for like the entire year and high school
"
601,SP2,"Yeah
"
602,SP1,"You probably gonna learn the same amount of stuff in like two semesters in chemistry like come one come to
"
603,SP2,"Yeah
"
604,SP1,"It's just gonna have to learn and this is in college Unisys a spin w hat the more time
"
605,SP2,"Yeah
"
606,SP1,"And like it's a single more depth political same this like the same units so this
"
607,SP2,"Yeah
"
608,SP1,"An extra few sections in the so like I was pretty happy
"
609,SP2,"Gotcha
"
610,SP2,"Because the like
"
611,SP2,"I was worried about that the first time I came and I just I was shock ed how quickly I adopted I guess to how fast it would go
"
612,SP1,"Uhuh
"
613,SP2,"Me in my mid term for mass and really showed adaptation but yeah I'd how fast the things going so it's I was always interested in how about
"
614,SP1,"Should be fine
"
615,SP2,"Closely yeah I mean everybody's got to do it so yeah he's gonna find a way to
"
616,SP1,"Did you pre um
"
617,SP2,"Pre o
"
618,SP1,"Sure so that's that's all that's the reason I got from a lot of people older freshman year

675,SP1,"That's the nice thing about it league here that's like the as of campus so I think this pick you up that way
"
676,SP2,"Go straight on the road

680,SP1,"That's that's a problem yeah no I got
"
681,SP2,"I mean next next year
"
682,SP1,"Oh that's the problem I don't know what I mean I also started fail eight so a lot of people have their things already
"
683,SP2,"Yeah
"
684,SP1,"Says there is stress also we didn't get our numbers from
"
685,SP1,"Did you find out
"
686,SP2,"Yeah
"
687,SP1,"Our of the housing for housing and like last year because all drama has people with like really low numbers
"
688,SP2,"Yeah
"
689,SP1,"I wouldn't get the places they wanted
"
690,SP2,"How do they determine who gets what lottery number
"
691,SP1,"Also all random
"
692,SP2,"I have a I am slightly inclined to say there
"
693,SP2,"It could not be but
"
694,SP1,"Umm
"
695,SP2,"I don't now
"
696,SP1,"There's always like theories and like stuff like that
"
697,SP2,"Yeah
"
698,SP1,"Conspiracy theories I mean they should change it
"
699,SP2,"Now I get we can prove anything about it's Virginia messy but
"
700,SP1,"Yeah yeah exactly Umm Lincoln's they one even though it people
"
701,SP2,"I mean
"
702,SP1,"Do it if they tried
"
703,SP2,"Yeah
"
704,SP1,"Yes the like I got a like the nineteenth Lois of like one thousand five hundred
"
705,SP2,"Oh
"
706,SP2,"Down
"
707,SP1,"So I just like
"
708,SP2,"He just got robbed basically
"
709,SP1,"Yes so like any for my friends who've real had real numbers or like not on the phone number with you what is that that's the only thing that we created like
"
710,SP2,"Yeah
"
711,SP1,"Gives armor with people either they didn't like or check people that they like because of their number what's a hopefully they'll change
"
712,SP2,"Could they do a good what how do they work that they take the lowest number and you to if you go together the low some
"
713,SP1,"They take
"
714,SP1,"Did they take average the together just so that
"
715,SP2,"Oh average okay was
"
716,SP1,"So that's why were it didn't work so like instantly like the the would be dismissed now they're trying to do like
"
717,SP2,"Yeah
"
718,SP1,"But again it's still gonna cause drama
"
719,SP2,"Yeah
"
720,SP1,"That's why I'm waiting to find out my number so like if it's real when I know that's not guaranteed then I'll have to work a lot harder in finding somewhere
"
721,SP2,"Yeah
"
722,SP1,"But if it's high then I'll just chill
"
723,SP2,"Gotcha I mean I've heard a bunch of uh kids on the club team were looking for off campus their sophomore years I think and they said either go early or go really late because in the middle it was kind of a weird limbo situation
"
724,SP1,"For what
"
725,SP2,"For housing
"
726,SP1,"Oh to search
"
727,SP2,"Yeah the search
"
728,SP1,"Mhm Yeah no I'd probably go pretty late then
"
729,SP2,"Yeah
"
730,SP2,"I mean why why bother about it now if it doesn't make any real difference
"
731,SP1,"Exactly like
"
732,SP2,"Yeah
"
733,SP1,"People do really early just to get out of the way
"
734,SP2,"Yeah
"
735,SP1,"But like
"
736,SP2,"What if you have other stuff to do
"
737,SP1,"And also if they're going to work or stay in summer
"
738,SP2,"Yeah
"
739,SP1,"A lot of the le they can get the leases start either like August September or June
"
740,SP1,"Yeah
"
741,SP2,"Yeah
"
742,SP1,"Because so if they started June like the whole like if classes end may tenth they'll have like a few weeks so find out what they're gonna do and then they can move into their house so like yeah
"
743,SP2,"yeah
"
744,SP1,"neat it's also feel find out real quick
"
745,SP2,"yeah
"
746,SP1,"I was definitely not the more and draw will part but it's still
"
747,SP2,"that's like all logistical like waiting around what's my what's my future here
"
748,SP2,"The employer I kinda hate that sensation of I can't do anything about it but like
"
749,SP1,"When you can't do anything that source
"
750,SP2,"Yeah
"
751,SP1,"That's why I would like always email them so at least I would like I feel like I'm doing something
"
752,SP2,"Yeah I feel
"
753,SP1,"Like if you push alarm a funny was little do it everyone
"
754,SP2,"Gotcha
"
755,SP1,"So you will don't suggest someone single so one singles someone single
"
756,SP2,"There's
"
757,SP1,"And like I had like the lowest number just like nobody if I didn't do that and there's I'd probably be in a double so and like the basement of like I don't even know where
"
758,SP1,"So like yet
"
759,SP1,"Those who push it
"
