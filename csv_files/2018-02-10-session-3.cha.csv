SP2,"like Cabot is like way too big for us 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"it's like 
"
SP1,"okay same 
"
SP2,"On I can I can't think we have more than like 
"
SP2,"Sixty people seventy maybe 
"
SP1,"Yeah cause I look around and like there's so many empty 
"
SP2,"Yeah 

SP1,"Chairs 
"
SP2,"No I definitely feel the same way 
"
SP1,"Um 
"
SP1,"but yeah no thanks so it's going well I think that's that hasn't really been a problem I kinda want to do the assignment this weekend 
"
SP2,"um 
"
SP2,"Mhm 
"
SP1,"Assignment one to get it out of the way 
"
SP2,"It does not look very difficult 
"
SP1,"It doesn't you just need to find two articles and so I just need to spend the time to do that 
"
SP2,"Mhm 
"
SP1,"um 
"
SP1,"Comp sci has been like 
"
SP2,"Comp eleven yeah 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"Yeah has been 
"
SP2,"Do you like it or 
"
SP1,"Yeah I like it it it feels so good to like finally get your program Working 
"
SP2,"Finish your code 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Mhm 
"
SP1,"Like after just struggling through it and like getting getting back syntax errors and um 
"
SP1,"Like oh and just or just like having it not work at all 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"kinda like having to figure out why um but 
"
SP2,"I feel like I'd like that class 
"
SP1,"It 
"
SP1,"I yeah I think you would it's definitely it definitely takes time 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah I like that 
"
SP2,"Like it's definitely like gets 
"
SP1,"definitely a week's worth of work cause like you gotta s like the way it works is you get assigned Homework on Thursday 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Mhm 
"
SP1,"and then basically you have n till next Thursday to do it all 
"
SP1,"um so 
"
SP2,"h How do you guys have like midterms and stuff in the 
"
SP1,"I don't know I'm kind of scared because like coding takes me awhile and if we have to do like coding in class 
"
SP2,"mm there's no I don't really think they make you do that 
"
SP1,"I hope not I don't know I I have to ask Henry see what they did 
"
SP2,"He's a he's a comp sci major right 
"
SP1,"Yeah he's in comp fifteen right now 
"
SP2,"I hear that fucking difficult 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"I'm sure 
"
SP2,"Yeah I wanted to take I actually wanted to take comp eleven this semester 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"I decided to take calc three instead I'll just take it cause I didn't want to take both 
"
SP1,"yeah that's Probably smart move 
"
SP2,"Um 
"
SP2,"Yeah so I'll take it probably in the fall 
"
SP1,"Yeah I w wanted to take comp ten just cause it was like it's like comp eleven except not for majors 
"
SP1,"like comp sci majors so it's likeA lot more easy going 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"but I l I literally showed up for the class the first week back and 
"
SP1,"Like I get there and there are the class is just absolutely packed 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Like everyone on the waitlist showed up 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Um so we were like twenty people over capacity 
"
SP2,"Geez how big is the class 
"
SP1,"not that big I think it was only supposed to hold like thirty thirty five people 
"
SP2,"mhm yeah 
"
SP1,"mm But there ended up being like fifty people there 
"
SP2,"damn 
"
SP1,"Um 
"
SP1,"e 
"
SP1,"s But like I was looking around and I'm pretty sure I was the only freshman in that room 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Um 
"
SP1,"And so yeah he like at the end fo class he was like gonna try and like um find a bigger room so like he could accommodate all the people that wanted to take the class which is like cool but then like you got an email from people saying like no we can't give you a bigger room you need to just Say no 
"
SP2,"They needed to cap the classes 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"That makes sense 
"
SP1,"Unfortunately 
"
SP2,"But you know I how do you like the guy I heard he's a little bit of a character 
"
SP1,"Which one 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"The comp sci guy 
"
SP1,"uh oh the professor 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah he 
"
SP1,"Yeah He's 
"
SP1,"Definitely interesting 
"
SP1,"He 
"
SP1,"I don't know it's like hard to describe he's 
"
SP1,"He's definitely he's very smart 
"
SP2,"mhm 
"
SP1,"that's for sure um and 
"
SP1,"He's like 
"
SP1,"His sense of humor is kind of like 
"
SP1,"That's so funny 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"It's kind of like a computer and away he um 
"
SP1,"Where they keep because like computer science like at the end of each step laid out um and so it 
"
SP2,"That's what is jokes so 
"
SP1,"Yeah it kind of so he oh 
"
SP1,"He's like he always flexes like out cannot process because blank is 
"
SP1,"It's hard 
"
SP2,"What what does he like go through coding class there 
"
SP1,"Hi it's more like the concept so like how to make how to do repetition um in like how to make the code do the same thing over and over for like an X amount of times um um so it's more like bigger concepts like that last class which is a fully like kinda went through how the computer thought about it or like you have basically every code and then 
"
SP2,"Mhm 
"
SP1,"Your word yeah you have your code and then 
"
SP1,"A lot of what coding is is functions which is like code inside of it's like 
"
SP1,"At this it's a string with like code inside of it so if you call the function than the code that's inside the functional run and you'll get like at 
"
SP2,"Oh put 
"
SP1,"So like X squared for example 
"
SP2,"Sure 
"
SP1,"Like that's that would be like a he had the square function or whatever if you like name your function like square and then wroteinside it how to like 
"
SP2,"Mhm 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Then um basically when you call a function M that'll run the what ask you to like input the number and then a like run the code and it'll um give you a number back and so he like to basically talked about how the computer will 
"
SP1,"Kind of for each action within that um within the code inside the function it a like um so if you wanted it to print hi or whatever it like create an activation record for print 
"
SP2,"Mhm 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"And then it will a good like analyze what it wants to print to be like okay once we print I can do that 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP1,"It'll send that back 
"
SP2,"It's pretty cool 
"
SP1,"It'll print that and then activation record will go away and 
"
SP1,"It 
"
SP1,"I don't know it that the special just gonna help me like wrap my head around um 
"
SP1,"Like what the computer is actually doing did the we're doing 
"
SP2,"Yeah it's definitely it's definitely really cool field like my dad like 
"
SP2,"I was like no like I'm helping pay for a college education this is the one causing did say 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Which is caught like comp eleven 
"
SP1,"I mean its fair 
"
SP2,"Uhm 
"
SP1,"That's so that's for Yeah 
"
SP2,"No no no and I like wanna take it anyway 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Thank you I think it was like kind of joking but 
"
SP1,"My dad thinks it yeah the same way it thinks it should all 
"
SP1,"Uhm 
"
SP2,"Just so it's like for everybody like understand like even though like or even a couple of is just like the basics right yet see plus plus 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Oh well we're doing python antsy both of 
"
SP2,"Okay 
"
SP2,"But like so I could just like now like you since you're able to code and both of those it like enables you to do jobs were like which like eighty percent coat eighty eighty percent noncoding but like twenty percent cutting 
"
SP1,"Yeah apparently after 
"
SP1,"Comp eleven and comp fifteen were at like an employable level of 
"
SP2,"Really 
"
SP1,"That's that's what someone told me around it's very 
"
SP2,"That's pretty cool 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"You're gonna keep gonna 
"
SP1,"Oh sell the rest of us are you has 
"
SP2,"The 
"
SP1,"Uhm figured out from here 
"
SP2,"Definitely 
"
SP2,"So taken is intro to finance class with the 
"
SP2,"My profession and David just go 
"
SP2,"He's like this guy who's never top before he's a tufts alarm 
"
SP2,"And he worked in finance for like 
"
SP2,"Thirty years whatever and I was teaching us he's such a character it's hilarious 
"
SP1,"Wow ok 
"
SP2,"He's not he's a really funny 
"
SP1,"Wait 
"
SP1,"It's good 
"
SP2,"He's he's also he's actually like a good teacher like 
"
SP1,"Is he a good teacher 
"
SP2,"Feel like a lot of those people are like I don't really know how the T a yard like it is it's like knowing the information doesn't enable you to teach the information 
"
SP1,"That's true 
"
SP2,"Right it's like 
"
SP1,"How will you convey it to people who don't know 
"
SP2,"Exactly and so using like techniques 
"
SP2,"To try and like 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"We only did yeah exactly just like demonstrated in a way that makes sense um 
"
SP1,"Yeah or 
"
SP2,"Yeah he's he's doing a good job of doctor it's really it's a really instinct us 
"
SP1,"What do you what he is doing when you learn about 
"
SP2,"So we start off with like my present future value of money 
"
SP1,"Okay 
"
SP2,"um so is the that that part has been pretty like equation happy 
"
SP1,"The question yeah 
"
SP2,"So it's Bella Akeno 
"
SP2,"F V was Peavey times the rate 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"To like 
"
SP1,"RT or whatever 
"
SP2,"To anticipate yet um you 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"That piano which is like period's and 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Then as the years 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Which is like it's interesting 
"
SP1,"The classic equation 
"
SP2,"Exactly yes like we start off at that 
"
SP1,"But you 
"
SP2,"Uhm to start off with that we did 
"
SP2,"Mr then we did like we doing with cash we did more of class cash flows so like 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"um like figuring out 
"
SP2,"Kind of like how to compare investments based on your cash flow 
"
SP2,"Which is pretty interesting that's a more equations basically um 
"
SP1,"Mhm 
"
SP2,"Now oh um we just finished 
"
SP2,"This thing called an PB and I are which is like 
"
SP2,"And TV is not present value 
"
SP1,"For yeah 
"
SP2,"And IR is 
"
SP2,"Something rate of return investment return probably 
"
SP1,"This 
"
SP2,"Um that's that's late that helps with like evaluating investments it's pretty interesting 
"
SP1,"Interesting 
"
SP2,"Um 
"
SP2,"Yeah like it we're movie on the bonds now which I think would be really cool we talk about like Bon pricing um and like it's the bond markets 
"
SP1,"That's a lot of work for intervention 
"
SP2,"Let's see we've had the first problems that was like the easiest thing I've ever done 
"
SP1,"You've only had one then 
"
SP2,"No we had to early like a third under on Tuesday 
"
SP1,"Uhm they like art 
"
SP2,"The second always difficult like 
"
SP2,"I 
"
SP2,"Like the first half was really easy and then the second half was like 
"
SP2,"Like more like word problems in like excel 
"
