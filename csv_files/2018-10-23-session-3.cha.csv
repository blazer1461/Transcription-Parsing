456,SP2,"True
"
457,SP1,"like you really can't

"
479,SP1,"and what we came up with yesterday was well my great idea was over the rainbow like we each be color of the rainbow cause there's like five of us
"
480,SP2,"its very five year old but
"
481,SP1,"It's easy and simple and you probably already have it in your closet
"
482,SP1,"They didn't like that idea they allwant to go
"
483,SP2,"Yeah I wonder why
"
484,SP1,"they wanna go thrift shopping
"
485,SP1,"and
"
486,SP2,"yeah that's the most yeah go to Goodwill
"
487,SP1,"no ap̲arently there's one in Davis

489,SP1,"there's apparently one in Davis
"
490,SP2,"Yes Goodwill
"
491,SP1,"oh is that actually a good will store
"
492,SP2,"oh maybe it's not I thought it was
"
493,SP1,"I thought it was just like another thrift store
"
494,SP2,"there's l
"
495,SP1,"really
"
496,SP1,"oh
"
497,SP2,"yeah
"
498,SP1,"I didnt even know I haven't seen any of them
"
499,SP2,"There's like one that's like there's one good one I forget what they're called one that's cool but it's like actually expensive
"
500,SP1,"The point like not the winter stress
"
501,SP2,"so you don't wanna g
"
502,SP2,"So it's not it's kind of defeats the purpose I mean it's not like expensive expensive but it's more expensive
"
503,SP1,"Okay
"
504,SP2,"And then there's one that's okay
"
505,SP1,"A good cheap but Frank you really wanna do Hippias
"
506,SP1,"His friend he wants to buy a pair of bell bottom jeans I think this will b e good reason to do it I don't I give off a hippie vibe so
"
507,SP2,"eh
"
508,SP1,"Yeah exactly I don't
"
509,SP1,"so we'll see what'll happen
"
510,SP2,"you could do it

511,SP1,"Another good idea was it all goes animals because mac and really wanted to be  um a lobster with her boyfriend he's going home for the weekend
"
512,SP2,"Okay wait okay it takes me a second to think of

520,SP2,"Yeah she should yeah she should be a lobster
"
521,SP1,"so that was a shame
"
522,SP2,"Um someone told me I should be a seagull
"
523,SP1,"Uhm that's really creative
"
524,SP2,"Yeah but that's a lot of effort I need to like
