"
SP1,"Must be rough like the reason why didn't choose that section that I wanna grab probably grab lunch 
"
SP2,"mm I still do that I get lunch before 
"
SP1,"that's nice 
"
SP2,"How's your early session 
"
SP1,"This conversation's so awkward 
"
SP1,"yeah Um it's been pretty good I um actually most of my friends from pre o we went to the same session 
"
SP2,"Oh 
"
SP1,"For psych so basically sit together 
"
SP2,"What preo did you do 
"
SP1,"Arts 
"

"
SP2,"mm 
"

"
SP1,"Yeah he's my high school is pretty funny 
"

"
SP2,"mm That's fair 
"

"
SP2,"I've been there too 
"
SP1,"English is England is pretty cool 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"the britain 
"
SP2,"how did you decide that if you could live anywhere you would live in Sweden 
"
SP1,"um How could I decide 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"How did you decide that 
"
SP1,"Oh um it's just 
"
SP1,"Culture why isn't probably cause um I used to study a little bit of art so 
"
SP1,"um I guess the environment there kind of attracts 
"
SP2,"mmm 
"
SP1,"me so 
"
SP2,"That's cool 
"
SP1,"Stockholm especially good city 
"
SP1,"O 
"
SP2,"What engineering Are you doing 
"
SP1,"Oh human factors engineer 
"
SP2,"okay 
"
SP1,"Kind of small program 
"
SP2,"oh that's cool 
"
SP1,"yeah Like in my um pre at pre major advisor session we only have like seven people 
"
SP1,"in 
"
SP2,"Really 
"
SP1,"In human factors engineering and others including me there are only two that are major in human factors 
"
SP2,"Really that's so small 
"
SP1,"Yeah but um on the graduating class was like forty students last year so I'm not worried people just might just switch in 
"
SP2,"Switch back in yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"I know a lot of people right now that are trying to switch into engineering 
"
SP1,"Oh really 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"I was thinking about switching to arts and science 
"
SP2,"Really yeah I feel like once people get here they decide that they don't want to necessarily do what they've signed up for 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"But yeah I have a lot of friends that came here as arts and sciences got here and then decided they wanted to do engineering 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"Fair enough the reason why I want to switch to art and sciences is like I don't I don't like computer science 
"
SP2,"mm 
"
SP1,"I've heard comp fifteen is pretty hard 
"
SP2,"Yeah I heard that too 
"
SP1,"So but I have to take that cause that's kinda the requirements for engineering school I'm not sure but I have to take comp eleven so 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"And that is not my thing my plan is to take no computer science classes 
"
SP1,"What's your major 
"
SP2,"I wanna do either bio or bio psych 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"and pre med 
"
SP1,"premed 
"
SP2,"So lots and lots of science labs 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"Are you taking physics this semester 
"
SP2,"No I'm taking chem 
"
SP1,"chem 
"
SP1,"I heard comments like like I heard chem only has like eight thirty sessions like 
"
SP2,"There's an eight thirty which is the one that I'm in and there's a one thirty but I have practice during the one thirty so I'm in the eight thirty 
"
SP1,"My f my uh roommate he's actually doing chem next semester and the only time slot available form him is the eight thirty one 
"
SP2,"mmm 
"
SP1,"that's kinda not good 
"
SP2,"Yeah I don't know it's good because then you get chem out of the way 
"
SP1,"That's true that's true 
"
SP2,"And then you can enjoy the rest of your day 
"
SP1,"that's true 
"
SP2,"cause you don't have to think about going to chemistry 
"
SP1,"Yeah I have math this semester eight thirty to nine twenty something for like three days 
"
SP2,"Love a good eight thirty class I have eight thirties on Monday 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"and Wednesday and then the rest is nine thirties 
"
SP1,"that's nice yeah my schedule this semester is kinda nice with Thursdays and Fridays cause I basically like my classes finish on thursday and Fridays in the morning so like eight thirty to nine thirty and then like another ten thirty to eleven forty five 
"
SP2,"mm 
"
SP1,"to like n and like no classes in the afternoon 
"
SP1,"so 
"
SP2,"well that's good 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"I feel like the worst would be to have a whole bunch of classes on Friday 
"
SP1,"Yeah no rest my goal for next semester is to have like three and three and a half days a weekend 
"
SP2,"ew 
"
SP1,"Like my my schedule right now um it doesn't have classes on Friday 
"
SP2,"Wow 
"
SP1,"And there is no morning classes and you like yeah like so for Monday Wednesday and Thursday I have class starts at one thirty ends about like eight or nine that's fine for me 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"and on Tuesday my class starts at three PM three thirty PM 
"
SP2,"Starts at three 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"wow 
"
SP1,"So like basically I can sleep my whole entire morning and then grab lunch and then go back probably go back to sleep again and then go to class 
"
SP2,"That sounds so nice my schedule for next semester I am trying to make it well I have to plan practice into my schedule 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"and my practice is from one thirty to six on Tuesdays through Fridays yeah it's a long time 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"So basically you don't have any free time in the afternoon 
"
SP2,"Basically yeah and so I have mostly morning classes but the way that I have it set up which I hope works out I only have one class on Friday and it's a chem recitation which isn't mandatory 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"and then I only have one class on Wednesdays also 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"but then I have two six thirty classes like six thirty PM Monday I have a six thirty lab and Thursday I have a six thirty class but it's fine 
"
SP1,"How many classes are youo taking um next semester 
"
SP2,"Four 
"
SP1,"Including the practice 
"
SP2,"Yeah I have chem English two French four and abnormal psych 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"I I feel like the practice It's kinda hard 
"
SP2,"Yeah it's a lot 
"
SP1,"I 
"
SP1,"I can never do like four to five or even three hours of might be three hours but not four hours of practice on a certain sports 
"
SP2,"It's nice though because like since our team has seventy people 
"
SP2,"which is huge compared to most sports 
"
SP1,"Oh wow 
"
SP1,"Yeah yeah 
"
SP2,"uh so they don't really notice slash care if you're not there everyday 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"and also like there's two different times you can come at one thirty or you can come at three and then uh Mondays we have no practice and Wednesdays a lot of people don't go because they can't so like this semester I went I went Tuesday Thursday Friday because I have class on Wednesdays 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"and so it just works 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Gotcha 
"
SP1,"How far is it from here 
"
SP2,"Ten minutes 
"
SP1,"oh 
"
SP2,"so we take cars 
"
SP1,"I see 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah I was uh I was I was planning to try some sports but I didn't get into basketball 
"
SP2,"uh 
"
SP1,"So that's kinda sucks but still play basketball casually with my friends 
"
SP2,"that's fun 
"
SP1,"It's just like the course load right now I I just finished my mid term last week 
"
SP2,"Oh 
"
SP1,"so I'm so I'm just planning to pick up my basketball 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Hopefully there's gonna be no exams close by I know there's a psych paper right 
"
SP2,"Yeah the papers due next week 
"
SP1,"On November the fifteenth 
"
SP2,"But it's a short paper 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"It's like a 
"
SP1,"so like six hundred words 
"
SP2,"yeah and like a mini summary of what you read 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"which is that's easy 
"
SP1,"I asked professor summers about like what kind of articles he's looking for because like I was kind of confused if he's only 
"
SP1,"Wanting us to find news articles or news plus psychology analysis 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"so so 
"
SP2,"What did he say 
"
SP1,"He he said on just anything anything would anything just related to psychology it's fine 
"
SP1,"I don't know 
"
SP2,"Yeah I need to find an article I was talking to someone yesterday who said she's doing hers on PTSD 
"
SP1,"oh PTSD that's nice 
"
SP2,"That's a that's a good one I feel like 
"
SP1,"I think I'm doing gender roles 
"
SP2,"Oh that's also good 
"
SP1,"Because like I'm not that into biological psychology it's just too hard for me 
"
SP2,"I prefer social psych 
"
SP1,"Same 
"
SP2,"I'm really excited about this next unit because we're doing social psych and uh 
"
SP1,"Media 
"
SP2,"Disorders 
"
SP1,"oh disorders 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"Yeah which I think are the the cool parts 
"
SP1,"mm I feel like it's so cool to like an analyze behaviors 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Um back in my high school I still I used to take um advanced econ but this class is considered consisted off like multiple areas one part of the class we actually learn behavioral psych so that' really really cool 
"
SP2,"Really 
"
SP1,"I I really like that 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"So that's pretty nice 
"
SP2,"Yeah that's why I wanna do abnormal psych 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"because that class is about like different disorders 
"
SP2,"You learn about disorders which I think is the cool psych stuff 
"
SP2,"I like everything else 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"I just feel like it's more fun to to learn about what people do and don't do and also now that I've been in this class sometimes I see people and start thinking about what they're doing 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"like I am part of junior jumbo's 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"do you know what that is 
"
SP2,"Okay it's this club where you go to a preschool once a week for two hours and you have a little buddy and you play with them little kid my buddies three 
"
SP1,"three years old 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"And I went last week after we had learned about attachment styles 
"
SP1,"pretty cute 
"
SP2,"and then I was like man I'm watching it applied in real life 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"Yeah how long is the program like for the club thing 
"
SP2,"It's the whole year 
"
SP1,"That okay 
"
SP1,"do you gotta pick the same one next year as well if you are deciding to keep doing this club 
"
SP2,"Pick the same what 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"Like the same kid 
"
SP2,"No 
"
SP1,"So like basically one kid per year 
"
SP2,"Yeah except that someone I talked to said that oh it was a teacher that works in the preschool now that used to do the club she had one buddy for two years in a row 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"and then a third different one so I guess it just depends 
"
SP2,"Because 
"
SP1,"cause I feel like I feel like it's gonna be so um 
"
SP1,"So cool I guess to keep in touch with the same person for like consecutive years 
"
SP2,"All of it yeah 
"
SP1,"Yeah to see what's happening around him or her 
"
SP2,"I feel like it depends on what age you get when you start off 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"because since it's a preschool they get too old to be there 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"I think the oldest you can be there is five 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"so in theory I could have my buddy for two years like this year and the next year 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"I don't know though 
"
SP2,"The youngest age is is less than two 
"
SP2,"Yeah they have baby babies 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"that's that's pretty cool 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Waving at the camera 
"
SP1,"There's also one behind me too 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Okay 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"Awkward silence 
"
SP2,"Okay if I were to go anywhere in the world 
"
SP1,"Yeah let's th let's let let let's pick up that conversation 
"
SP2,"Yes I would go to Australia 
"
SP1,"Australia 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"Yes  because I wanna go scuba dive uh the Great Barrier Reef because it's so cool 
"
SP1,"why 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"And also just because Australia's I feel like a place it's just a place that you should visit cause they have so much they have kangaroos they have koalas 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"they have a ridiculous amount of ocean life 
"
SP1,"That's true 
"
SP2,"And also everything that can kill you scorpions snakes 
"
SP1,"Jellyfish 
"
SP2,"Forest fires jellyfish great white sharks 
"
SP2,"So much fun 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP1,"Australia seems to be a really nice place my high school used to have like a exchange program to Australia for twenty days 
"
SP1,"during a winter break 
"
SP2,"ugh 
"
SP2,"That's so cool 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"

"
SP2,"My I don't have one I only work in the summer 

"
SP1,"Wait does tufts 
"
SP2,"To use 
"
SP1,"will tufts cover your tuition in Australia 

SP1,"Trying to do like German one two three four for my freshman year and my sophomore year so that can probably study abroad 
"
SP2,"Eventually 
"
SP1,"In my junior year or my my senior year I'm not sure cause the thing it's it's not only the culture but also the um my field in German so popular 
"
SP1,"like industrial design wise 
"
SP2,"oh 
"
SP1,"German has probably the best industrial design programs in the world 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"Also Britain but uh 
"
SP2,"You already speak English you're good 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"I'm trying to learn German 
"
SP2,"yeah that's cool 
"
SP1,"At at least I'll yeah because if I'm going to study abroad I have to be like in German four 
"
SP2,"So that you can actually converse with people 
"
SP1,"Right 
"
SP2,"I take French 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"And I wanna go to France this summer the tufts and how are maybe we'll see um but yeah I don't know I've I've been taking French for so long that when I got here I was like well I feel like I have to continue so that I can actually learn how to speak it because French programs in Texas are not very good so even though I took French for like five years 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"I learned the exact same thing every year 
"
SP2,"which is nothing 
"
SP1,"hm 
"
SP2,"which isn't super helpful when you're trying to talk to people 
"
SP1,"True 
"
SP1,"Are you still learn like two years I'm in actually one year of German back in my high school but that didn't help because we only have two classes per week ands sometimes the teacher would not be there so basically have self studies 
"
SP2,"You only had class two days a week 
"
SP2,"
"
SP1,"No I'm in two days for German 
"
SP2,"For for German 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP1,"Back at my high school 
"
SP1,"so that's not good because 
"
SP2,"Wow 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"Once I learn something on Monday I'll basically forgot on Friday 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP1,"and over the weekend I have no incentive to review German then back to Monday I basically forgot everything again 
"
SP2,"Yeah that's rough 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"So I basically didn't learn anything from my high school still start in college 
"
SP2,"You're you're starting over 
"
SP1,"I guess 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"That's okay German seems hard I have a friend that's in Geone he seems like he's struggling a little bit 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"he said it's easy but also hard at the same time 
"
SP1,"who is his it was his name 
"
SP2,"Cole 
"
SP1,"Cole 
"
SP1,"
"
SP1,"Yeah he's not in my section 
"
SP1,"Yeah so yeah Germans pretty fun um 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"So are you gonna do did you test out of any of the language requirement 
"
SP1,"um I placed out of English cause I took AP English back in my high school um except for that one no 
"
SP1,"But I placed out of some like some physics and chemistry things 
"
SP1,"so that that that kind of helps 
"
SP2,"Oh cool 
"
SP1,"That that that actually really helps saves my time next semester so that so that I don't have to wake up at eight thirty 
"
SP2,"I got credit for calc 
"
SP1,"oh calc BC 
"
SP1,"
"
SP2,"AB 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP2,"so I have to take only one other math and then for English I tested out of half of the English credit 
"
SP2,"so I have to take English two 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"and then for language I placed out of French two and th one and two 
"
SP1,"So you're starting in French three 
"
SP2,"so I'm in th 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"That's really nice I think 
"
SP2,"Yeah so I'm gonna do three and then I'm doing four next semester and then if I go to France over the summer I'll do five there 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"And then six when I come back 
"
SP1,"it's nice I don't th 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"Yeah for me I'm yeah I'm planning to do like German one two three four for my sophomore and freshman year 
"
SP2,"And then are you gonna do 
"
SP1,"Study abroad 
"
SP2,"hmm 
"
SP1,"probably 
"
SP1,"If I have that time 
"
SP1,"I really want to 
"
SP2,"yeah I feel like study abroad would be so fun 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"would you go for a year or would you go for a semester 
"
SP1,"I'll probably go for one semester 
"
SP2,"Yeah me too I feel like it's just it just makes more sense to only go for a semester 
"
SP2,"because then that way like you don't fall behind 
"
SP1,"Right 
"
SP2,"In anything 
"
SP1,"mhm 
"
SP1,"Yeah I don't miss my family And my friends here so 
"
SP2,"Yeah yeah because if you but also the good thing about if you go abroad junior year is like most people are also going abroad junior year 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"So like you and your friends might be gone at the same time so then you come back 
"
SP1,"True 
"
SP2,"And it's not like like it wouldn't be fun if your friend went abroad like sophomore year and then you go junior year 
"
SP1,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"And then you're like friends only for freshman and senior year 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP1,"True 
"
SP1,"Yeah and another thing I'm kind of worry about studying abroad it's like 
"
SP1,"uh a definitely language problems cause although I might study one two three four That doesn't mean like it's gonna help me in the daily conversations 
"
SP2,"Yeah 
"
SP2,"Yeah yeah 
"
SP1,"Still so is the same thing cause we we took English classes back in China but those classes don't necessarily prepare you for English conversations 
"
SP2,"Yeah that's fair 
"
SP1,"like 
"
SP1,"Yeah so like it's only test prep 
"
SP2,"It's different 
"
SP2,"yeah 
"
SP1,"yeah 
"
SP2,"But the good thing also about studying abroad is that like once you get there by the time you leave you're gonna be so good at conversation 
"
SP1,"mm 
"
SP2,"cause you'll only be speaking for the most part in that language for a good chunk of your time for an entire semester 
"
SP1,"mm 
