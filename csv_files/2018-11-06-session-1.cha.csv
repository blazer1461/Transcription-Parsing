1,SP2,"hey
"
2,SP1,"What's up
"
3,SP2,"I'm paige
"
4,SP1,"Hi Paige I'm Eragon
"
5,SP2,"Eragon
"
6,SP1,"Yes
"
7,SP2,"Oh cool what year are you
"
8,SP1,"Um freshmen
"
9,SP2,"Oh me too
"
10,SP1,"Which session is your um psychology class
"
11,SP2,"The twelve o'clock
"
12,SP1,"Must be rough like the reason why didn't choose that section that I wanna grab probably grab lunch
"
13,SP2,"mm I still do that I get lunch before
"
14,SP1,"that's nice
"
15,SP2,"How's your early session
"
16,SP1,"This conversation's so awkward
"
17,SP1,"yeah Um it's been pretty good I um actually most of my friends from pre o we went to the same session
"
18,SP2,"Oh
"
19,SP1,"For psych so basically sit together
"
20,SP2,"What preo did you do
"
21,SP1,"Arts
"
22,SP2,"Oh cool
"
23,SP1,"It's like I think arts it's the new um pre o this year
"
24,SP2,"What did you do
"
25,SP1,"But basically messing around with markers papers and
"
26,SP2,"During that one
"
27,SP1,"but Yeah I mean um like I thought arts are supposed to like only for art students
"
28,SP1,"from S MFA
"
29,SP2,"Yeah
"
30,SP1,"But apparently like I'm not I'm an engineer student
"
31,SP2,"mm
"
32,SP1,"so I still went to arts and there are CS students there also like art and science students so like there are they're in there were not much things to do with the the actual arts like art art museums
"
33,SP2,"Oh really
"
34,SP1,"so we'd basically just u um we went to this like the museum of fine arts for sure we had lunch there was pretty nice but except for that part we didn't do much things about actual art
"
35,SP2,"What else did you do then
"
36,SP1,"uh we we we draw hands
"
37,SP2,"ooo
"
38,SP2,"Like t tracing them
"
39,SP1,"a
"
40,SP2,"or drawing them
"
41,SP1,"Yeah
"
42,SP1,"yeah tracing the hands
"
43,SP2,"oh okay
"
44,SP1,"And um we also went to a laser gun fight
"
45,SP2,"Really
"
46,SP1,"Yeah
"
47,SP2,"Like laser tag
"
48,SP1,"Sorta yeah
"
49,SP2,"That's so cool
"
50,SP1,"Yeah but like I feel like that's that has nothing to do with arts
"
51,SP2,"Definitely not
"
52,SP1,"It's just getting us to
"
53,SP2,"know people
"
54,SP1,"Right
"
55,SP2,"How long was yours
"
56,SP1,"Arts it's like five days

58,SP1,"about a week um
"
59,SP1,"Yeah did you do any pre os
"
60,SP2,"Yeah I did fit
"
61,SP1,"fit
"
62,SP2,"same length
"
63,SP1,"mm
"
64,SP2,"I think

65,SP2,"I don't remember
"
66,SP1,"mm
"
67,SP1,"Yeah
"
68,SP2,"But different
"
69,SP1,"like
"
70,SP1,"Yeah to to it's probably the longest
"
71,SP2,"Yeah ours started like a little bit after two
"
72,SP1,"mhm
"
73,SP1,"mine's twenty seven to September the second something to's much longer
"
74,SP2,"maybe mine was the same length it was fun though we did a whole bunch of sports
"
75,SP1,"mm
"
76,SP2,"like we had exercise days where we had to pick an exercise you could go outside and run or you could do like pilates or Krav Maga
"
77,SP1,"What's Krav Magra
"
78,SP2,"Self defense
"
79,SP1,"Oo
"
80,SP2,"There were two days I did pilates the first day and I did krav maga the second day
"
81,SP1,"Wow
"
82,SP2,"pilates is is I thought it was like dance exercising but it's not it's so hard yeah and then krav krav maga was it was super weird we just learned some like hiyah

"
129,SP1,"Yeah
"
130,SP1,"right
"
131,SP1,"Yeah
"
132,SP1,"Still it's across the country flight
"
133,SP2,"Yeah
"
134,SP1,"It's like
"
135,SP2,"It's far to get to Washington state
"
136,SP1,"Yeah
"
137,SP2,"um I live in Texas
"
138,SP1,"mhm
"
139,SP2,"which is I mean not not quite as far as China but still not here yeah
"
140,SP1,"Yeah yeah I um I'm always one of like go Texas for a visit because uh I like basketball exports
"
141,SP2,"Yeah
"
142,SP1,"So maybe watch them play basketball is a good option but um the thing it's um also my favorite physics teacher he lives he he's from Texas
"
143,SP2,"Oh really
"
144,SP1,"Yeah he's my high school is pretty funny
"
145,SP1,"um
"
146,SP2,"Where in Texas would you go if you went to Texas do you know
"
147,SP1,"mm
"
148,SP1,"good question
"
149,SP1,"Dallas maybe
"
150,SP2,"Dallas really
"
151,SP1,"Or Houston
"
152,SP2,"Houston's it I live in Houston
"
153,SP1,"mm Houston Houston rockets
"
154,SP2,"I Perso
"
155,SP2,"Yeah
"
156,SP2,"I personally feel that Dallas is on the lower end of the cool places in Texas to go if you're gonna go anywhere go to Austin
"
157,SP1,"Oh yeah
"
158,SP2,"because they have lakes and rivers no one else has water
"
159,SP2,"Um and then Houston is fun cause this big city
"
160,SP2,"and yeah we have the rockets and the Astros
"
161,SP1,"mhm
"
162,SP1,"mhm
"
163,SP2,"and then San Antonio cause they have the river walk
"
164,SP1,"Oh yeah
"
165,SP1,"mhm
"
166,SP1,"mhm
"
167,SP2,"And then Dallas because Dallas has nothing
"
168,SP1,"mm
"
169,SP1,"Also the basketball team in Dallas sucks so
"
170,SP2,"Yeah
"
171,SP1,"The Mavericks
"
172,SP2,"Yeah
"
173,SP1,"it's kinda lame
"
174,SP1,"Anyway um
"
175,SP1,"What else
"
176,SP1,"It's just so awkward to start a conversation from like nowhere
"
177,SP2,"Yeah make up one how about this if you could go anywhere in the world where would you go
"
178,SP1,"that's such an ice breaker question
"
179,SP1,"Anywhere in the world I will
"
180,SP1,"Like for me I wanna live in um Sweden
"
181,SP2,"Oh cool have you ever been
"
182,SP1,"Now
"
183,SP2,"me neither
"
184,SP2,"but it looks like a cool place to go
"
185,SP1,"no
"
186,SP1,"Yeah like I haven't been to like the northern European region
"
187,SP1,"Well if if English still counts as part of the Europe union then I have
"
188,SP1,"But I'm not sure if it's still counts right now
"
189,SP2,"mm That's fair
"
190,SP1,"hm
"
191,SP2,"I've been there too
"
192,SP1,"English is England is pretty cool
"
193,SP2,"Yeah
"
194,SP1,"the britain
"
195,SP2,"how did you decide that if you could live anywhere you would live in Sweden
"
196,SP1,"um How could I decide
"
197,SP2,"How did you decide that
"
198,SP1,"Oh um it's just
"
199,SP1,"Culture why isn't probably cause um I used to study a little bit of art so
"
200,SP1,"um I guess the environment there kind of attracts
"
201,SP2,"mmm
"
202,SP1,"me so
"
203,SP2,"That's cool
"
204,SP1,"Stockholm especially good city
"
205,SP1,"O
"
206,SP2,"What engineering Are you doing
"
207,SP1,"Oh human factors engineer
"
208,SP2,"okay
"
209,SP1,"Kind of small program
"
210,SP2,"oh that's cool
"
211,SP1,"yeah Like in my um pre at pre major advisor session we only have like seven people
"
212,SP1,"in
"
213,SP2,"Really
"
214,SP1,"In human factors engineering and others including me there are only two that are major in human factors
"
215,SP2,"Really that's so small
"
216,SP1,"Yeah but um on the graduating class was like forty students last year so I'm not worried people just might just switch in
"
217,SP2,"Switch back in yeah
"
218,SP1,"Yeah
"
219,SP2,"I know a lot of people right now that are trying to switch into engineering
"
220,SP1,"Oh really
"
221,SP2,"Yeah
"
222,SP1,"I was thinking about switching to arts and science
"
223,SP2,"Really yeah I feel like once people get here they decide that they don't want to necessarily do what they've signed up for
"
224,SP1,"Yeah
"
225,SP2,"But yeah I have a lot of friends that came here as arts and sciences got here and then decided they wanted to do engineering
"
226,SP1,"mm
"
227,SP1,"Fair enough the reason why I want to switch to art and sciences is like I don't I don't like computer science
"
228,SP2,"mm
"
229,SP1,"I've heard comp fifteen is pretty hard
"
230,SP2,"Yeah I heard that too
"
231,SP1,"So but I have to take that cause that's kinda the requirements for engineering school I'm not sure but I have to take comp eleven so
"
232,SP1,"yeah
"
233,SP2,"And that is not my thing my plan is to take no computer science classes
"
234,SP1,"What's your major
"
235,SP2,"I wanna do either bio or bio psych
"
236,SP1,"mhm
"
237,SP2,"and pre med
"
238,SP1,"premed
"
239,SP2,"So lots and lots of science labs
"
240,SP1,"mm
"
241,SP1,"Are you taking physics this semester
"
242,SP2,"No I'm taking chem
"
243,SP1,"chem
"
244,SP1,"I heard comments like like I heard chem only has like eight thirty sessions like
"
245,SP2,"There's an eight thirty which is the one that I'm in and there's a one thirty but I have practice during the one thirty so I'm in the eight thirty
"
246,SP1,"My f my uh roommate he's actually doing chem next semester and the only time slot available form him is the eight thirty one
"
247,SP2,"mmm
"
248,SP1,"that's kinda not good
"
249,SP2,"Yeah I don't know it's good because then you get chem out of the way
"
250,SP1,"That's true that's true
"
251,SP2,"And then you can enjoy the rest of your day
"
252,SP1,"that's true
"
253,SP2,"cause you don't have to think about going to chemistry
"
254,SP1,"Yeah I have math this semester eight thirty to nine twenty something for like three days
"
255,SP2,"Love a good eight thirty class I have eight thirties on Monday
"
256,SP1,"mhm
"
257,SP2,"and Wednesday and then the rest is nine thirties
"
258,SP1,"that's nice yeah my schedule this semester is kinda nice with Thursdays and Fridays cause I basically like my classes finish on thursday and Fridays in the morning so like eight thirty to nine thirty and then like another ten thirty to eleven forty five
"
259,SP2,"mm
"
260,SP1,"to like n and like no classes in the afternoon
"
261,SP1,"so
"
262,SP2,"well that's good
"
263,SP1,"Yeah
"
264,SP2,"I feel like the worst would be to have a whole bunch of classes on Friday
"
265,SP1,"Yeah no rest my goal for next semester is to have like three and three and a half days a weekend
"
266,SP2,"ew
"
267,SP1,"Like my my schedule right now um it doesn't have classes on Friday
"
268,SP2,"Wow
"
269,SP1,"And there is no morning classes and you like yeah like so for Monday Wednesday and Thursday I have class starts at one thirty ends about like eight or nine that's fine for me
"
270,SP2,"Yeah
"
271,SP1,"and on Tuesday my class starts at three PM three thirty PM
"
272,SP2,"Starts at three
"
273,SP1,"Yeah
"
274,SP2,"wow
"
275,SP1,"So like basically I can sleep my whole entire morning and then grab lunch and then go back probably go back to sleep again and then go to class
"
276,SP2,"That sounds so nice my schedule for next semester I am trying to make it well I have to plan practice into my schedule
"
277,SP1,"mhm
"
278,SP2,"and my practice is from one thirty to six on Tuesdays through Fridays yeah it's a long time
"
279,SP2,"Yeah
"
280,SP1,"So basically you don't have any free time in the afternoon
"
281,SP2,"Basically yeah and so I have mostly morning classes but the way that I have it set up which I hope works out I only have one class on Friday and it's a chem recitation which isn't mandatory
"
282,SP1,"mhm
"
283,SP2,"and then I only have one class on Wednesdays also
"
284,SP1,"mm
"
285,SP2,"but then I have two six thirty classes like six thirty PM Monday I have a six thirty lab and Thursday I have a six thirty class but it's fine
"
286,SP1,"How many classes are youo taking um next semester
"
287,SP2,"Four
"
288,SP1,"Including the practice
"
289,SP2,"Yeah I have chem English two French four and abnormal psych
"
290,SP1,"mm
"
291,SP1,"I I feel like the practice It's kinda hard
"
292,SP2,"Yeah it's a lot
"
293,SP1,"I
"
294,SP1,"I can never do like four to five or even three hours of might be three hours but not four hours of practice on a certain sports
"
295,SP2,"It's nice though because like since our team has seventy people
"
296,SP2,"which is huge compared to most sports
"
297,SP1,"Oh wow
"
298,SP1,"Yeah yeah
"
299,SP2,"uh so they don't really notice slash care if you're not there everyday
"
300,SP1,"mm
"
301,SP2,"and also like there's two different times you can come at one thirty or you can come at three and then uh Mondays we have no practice and Wednesdays a lot of people don't go because they can't so like this semester I went I went Tuesday Thursday Friday because I have class on Wednesdays
"
302,SP1,"mm
"
303,SP2,"and so it just works
"
304,SP2,"Yeah
"
305,SP1,"Gotcha
"
306,SP1,"How far is it from here
"
307,SP2,"Ten minutes
"
308,SP1,"oh
"
309,SP2,"so we take cars
"
310,SP1,"I see
"
311,SP2,"yeah
"
312,SP1,"Yeah I was uh I was I was planning to try some sports but I didn't get into basketball
"
313,SP2,"uh
"
314,SP1,"So that's kinda sucks but still play basketball casually with my friends
"
315,SP2,"that's fun
"
316,SP1,"It's just like the course load right now I I just finished my mid term last week
"
317,SP2,"Oh
"
318,SP1,"so I'm so I'm just planning to pick up my basketball
"
319,SP2,"Yeah
"
320,SP1,"Hopefully there's gonna be no exams close by I know there's a psych paper right
"
321,SP2,"Yeah the papers due next week
"
322,SP1,"On November the fifteenth
"
323,SP2,"But it's a short paper
"
324,SP1,"yeah
"
325,SP2,"It's like a
"
326,SP1,"so like six hundred words
"
327,SP2,"yeah and like a mini summary of what you read
"
328,SP1,"mm
"
329,SP2,"which is that's easy
"
330,SP1,"I asked professor summers about like what kind of articles he's looking for because like I was kind of confused if he's only
"
331,SP1,"Wanting us to find news articles or news plus psychology analysis
"
332,SP2,"Yeah
"
333,SP1,"so so
"
334,SP2,"What did he say
"
335,SP1,"He he said on just anything anything would anything just related to psychology it's fine
"
336,SP1,"I don't know
"
337,SP2,"Yeah I need to find an article I was talking to someone yesterday who said she's doing hers on PTSD
"
338,SP1,"oh PTSD that's nice
"
339,SP2,"That's a that's a good one I feel like
"
340,SP1,"I think I'm doing gender roles
"
341,SP2,"Oh that's also good
"
342,SP1,"Because like I'm not that into biological psychology it's just too hard for me
"
343,SP2,"I prefer social psych
"
344,SP1,"Same
"
345,SP2,"I'm really excited about this next unit because we're doing social psych and uh
"
346,SP1,"Media
"
347,SP2,"Disorders
"
348,SP1,"oh disorders
"
349,SP2,"Yeah which I think are the the cool parts
"
350,SP1,"mm I feel like it's so cool to like an analyze behaviors
"
351,SP2,"Yeah
"
352,SP1,"Um back in my high school I still I used to take um advanced econ but this class is considered consisted off like multiple areas one part of the class we actually learn behavioral psych so that' really really cool
"
353,SP2,"Really
"
354,SP1,"I I really like that
"
355,SP2,"yeah
"
356,SP1,"So that's pretty nice
"
357,SP2,"Yeah that's why I wanna do abnormal psych
"
358,SP1,"mhm
"
359,SP2,"because that class is about like different disorders
"
360,SP2,"You learn about disorders which I think is the cool psych stuff
"
361,SP2,"I like everything else
"
362,SP1,"mm
"
363,SP2,"I just feel like it's more fun to to learn about what people do and don't do and also now that I've been in this class sometimes I see people and start thinking about what they're doing
"
364,SP1,"mm
"
365,SP2,"like I am part of junior jumbo's
"
366,SP1,"mm
"
367,SP2,"do you know what that is
"
368,SP2,"Okay it's this club where you go to a preschool once a week for two hours and you have a little buddy and you play with them little kid my buddies three
"
369,SP1,"three years old
"
370,SP2,"Yeah
"
371,SP2,"And I went last week after we had learned about attachment styles
"
372,SP1,"pretty cute
"
373,SP2,"and then I was like man I'm watching it applied in real life
"
374,SP1,"mm
"
375,SP1,"Yeah how long is the program like for the club thing
"
376,SP2,"It's the whole year
"
377,SP1,"That okay
"
378,SP1,"do you gotta pick the same one next year as well if you are deciding to keep doing this club
"
379,SP2,"Pick the same what
"
380,SP1,"Like the same kid
"
381,SP2,"No
"
382,SP1,"So like basically one kid per year
"
383,SP2,"Yeah except that someone I talked to said that oh it was a teacher that works in the preschool now that used to do the club she had one buddy for two years in a row
"
384,SP1,"mm
"
385,SP2,"and then a third different one so I guess it just depends
"
386,SP2,"Because
"
387,SP1,"cause I feel like I feel like it's gonna be so um
"
388,SP1,"So cool I guess to keep in touch with the same person for like consecutive years
"
389,SP2,"All of it yeah
"
390,SP1,"Yeah to see what's happening around him or her
"
391,SP2,"I feel like it depends on what age you get when you start off
"
392,SP1,"mhm
"
393,SP2,"because since it's a preschool they get too old to be there
"
394,SP1,"mm
"
395,SP2,"I think the oldest you can be there is five
"
396,SP1,"mm
"
397,SP2,"so in theory I could have my buddy for two years like this year and the next year
"

408,SP1,"Okay
"
409,SP1,"mm
"
410,SP1,"Awkward silence
"
411,SP2,"Okay if I were to go anywhere in the world
"
412,SP1,"Yeah let's th let's let let let's pick up that conversation
"
413,SP2,"Yes I would go to Australia
"
414,SP1,"Australia
"
415,SP2,"Yes  because I wanna go scuba dive uh the Great Barrier Reef because it's so cool
"
416,SP1,"why
"
417,SP1,"mhm
"
418,SP2,"And also just because Australia's I feel like a place it's just a place that you should visit cause they have so much they have kangaroos they have koalas
"
419,SP1,"mhm
"
420,SP2,"they have a ridiculous amount of ocean life
"
421,SP1,"That's true
"
422,SP2,"And also everything that can kill you scorpions snakes
"
423,SP1,"Jellyfish
"
424,SP2,"Forest fires jellyfish great white sharks
"
425,SP2,"So much fun
"
426,SP1,"mhm
"
427,SP1,"Australia seems to be a really nice place my high school used to have like a exchange program to Australia for twenty days
"
428,SP1,"during a winter break
"
429,SP2,"ugh
"
430,SP2,"That's so cool
"
431,SP1,"Yeah
"
432,SP2,"I wanna go I wanna study abroad in Australia
"
433,SP1,"mm That's nice
"
434,SP1,"does tufts have a
"
435,SP2,"cause
"
436,SP1,"Australia study abroad program
"
437,SP2,"I have no idea but you can do non tufts programs
"
438,SP1,"True
"
439,SP2,"So if they don't have one I'm gonna find a way to get to Australia
"
440,SP1,"that's right
"
441,SP2,"also apparently the minimum wage in Australia is really high
"
442,SP1,"Oh
"
443,SP2,"It's like eighteen dollars eighteen US dollars the minimum wage in Texas is seven fifty
"
444,SP1,"For real
"
445,SP2,"Yeah it's super I think whatever it super low
"
446,SP1,"mm
"
447,SP2,"It's higher here than it is in Texas I think it's like twelve here maybe fourteen I have no clue
"
448,SP1,"I'm not sure I can't do part time jobs because for international students we have to be a sophomore year to get my um Social security number
"
449,SP2,"Yeah
"
450,SP1,"So I can't do it
"
451,SP2,"My I don't have one I only work in the summer
"
452,SP1,"mm
"
453,SP2,"at home but I feel like it would be smart to go work in Australia because then you can save up a whole bunch of money and then bring it here
"
454,SP1,"Wait does tufts
"
455,SP2,"To use
"
456,SP1,"will tufts cover your tuition in Australia
"
457,SP2,"I think it's like carries with you
"
458,SP1,"hm
"
459,SP2,"I don't really know I haven't looked that deeply into it
"
460,SP2,"But also I have time
"
461,SP1,"mhm
"
462,SP1,"That's only our freshman year
"
463,SP2,"Yeah
"
464,SP1,"So
"
465,SP1,"Yeah I wanna study abroad too probably Germany
"
466,SP2,"mm
"
467,SP1,"I'm in German one
"
468,SP2,"Oh cool
"
469,SP1,"Trying to do like German one two three four for my freshman year and my sophomore year so that can probably study abroad
"
470,SP2,"Eventually
"
471,SP1,"In my junior year or my my senior year I'm not sure cause the thing it's it's not only the culture but also the um my field in German so popular
"
472,SP1,"like industrial design wise
"
473,SP2,"oh
"
474,SP1,"German has probably the best industrial design programs in the world
"
475,SP2,"yeah
"
476,SP1,"Also Britain but uh
"
477,SP2,"You already speak English you're good
"
478,SP1,"mm
"
479,SP1,"I'm trying to learn German
"
480,SP2,"yeah that's cool
"
481,SP1,"At at least I'll yeah because if I'm going to study abroad I have to be like in German four
"
482,SP2,"So that you can actually converse with people
"
483,SP1,"Right
"
484,SP2,"I take French
"
485,SP1,"mhm
"
486,SP2,"And I wanna go to France this summer the tufts and how are maybe we'll see um but yeah I don't know I've I've been taking French for so long that when I got here I was like well I feel like I have to continue so that I can actually learn how to speak it because French programs in Texas are not very good so even though I took French for like five years
"
487,SP1,"mhm
"
488,SP2,"I learned the exact same thing every year
"
489,SP2,"which is nothing
"
490,SP1,"hm
"
491,SP2,"which isn't super helpful when you're trying to talk to people
"
492,SP1,"True
"
493,SP1,"Are you still learn like two years I'm in actually one year of German back in my high school but that didn't help because we only have two classes per week ands sometimes the teacher would not be there so basically have self studies
"
494,SP2,"You only had class two days a week
"
495,SP1,"No I'm in two days for German
"
496,SP2,"For for German
"
497,SP1,"yeah
"
498,SP1,"Back at my high school
"
499,SP1,"so that's not good because
"
500,SP2,"Wow
"
501,SP2,"Yeah
"
502,SP1,"Once I learn something on Monday I'll basically forgot on Friday
"
503,SP2,"Yeah
"
504,SP1,"and over the weekend I have no incentive to review German then back to Monday I basically forgot everything again
"
505,SP2,"Yeah that's rough
"
506,SP1,"mm
"
507,SP1,"So I basically didn't learn anything from my high school still start in college
"
508,SP2,"You're you're starting over
"
509,SP1,"I guess
"
510,SP1,"Yeah
"
511,SP2,"That's okay German seems hard I have a friend that's in Geone he seems like he's struggling a little bit
"
512,SP1,"mm
"
513,SP2,"he said it's easy but also hard at the same time
"
514,SP1,"who is his it was his name
"
515,SP2,"Cole
"
516,SP1,"Cole
"
517,SP1,"Yeah he's not in my section
"
518,SP1,"Yeah so yeah Germans pretty fun um
"
519,SP1,"Yeah
"
520,SP2,"So are you gonna do did you test out of any of the language requirement
"
521,SP1,"um I placed out of English cause I took AP English back in my high school um except for that one no
"
522,SP1,"But I placed out of some like some physics and chemistry things
"
523,SP1,"so that that that kind of helps
"
524,SP2,"Oh cool
"
525,SP1,"That that that actually really helps saves my time next semester so that so that I don't have to wake up at eight thirty
"
526,SP2,"I got credit for calc
"
527,SP1,"oh calc BC
"
528,SP2,"AB
"
529,SP1,"mhm
"
530,SP2,"so I have to take only one other math and then for English I tested out of half of the English credit
"
531,SP2,"so I have to take English two
"
532,SP1,"mm
"
533,SP2,"and then for language I placed out of French two and th one and two
"
534,SP1,"So you're starting in French three
"
535,SP2,"so I'm in th
"
536,SP2,"yeah
"
537,SP1,"That's really nice I think
"
538,SP2,"Yeah so I'm gonna do three and then I'm doing four next semester and then if I go to France over the summer I'll do five there
"
539,SP1,"mm
"
540,SP2,"And then six when I come back
"
541,SP1,"it's nice I don't th
"
542,SP1,"mm
"
543,SP1,"Yeah for me I'm yeah I'm planning to do like German one two three four for my sophomore and freshman year
"
544,SP2,"And then are you gonna do
"
545,SP1,"Study abroad
"
546,SP2,"hmm
"
547,SP1,"probably
"
548,SP1,"If I have that time
"
549,SP1,"I really want to
"
550,SP2,"yeah I feel like study abroad would be so fun
"
551,SP1,"Yeah
"
552,SP2,"would you go for a year or would you go for a semester
"
553,SP1,"I'll probably go for one semester
"
554,SP2,"Yeah me too I feel like it's just it just makes more sense to only go for a semester
"
555,SP2,"because then that way like you don't fall behind
"
556,SP1,"Right
"
557,SP2,"In anything
"
558,SP1,"mhm
"
559,SP1,"Yeah I don't miss my family And my friends here so
"
560,SP2,"Yeah yeah because if you but also the good thing about if you go abroad junior year is like most people are also going abroad junior year
"
561,SP1,"mm
"
562,SP2,"So like you and your friends might be gone at the same time so then you come back
"
563,SP1,"True
"
564,SP2,"And it's not like like it wouldn't be fun if your friend went abroad like sophomore year and then you go junior year
"
565,SP1,"Yeah
"
566,SP2,"And then you're like friends only for freshman and senior year
"
567,SP1,"mm
"
568,SP1,"True
"
569,SP1,"Yeah and another thing I'm kind of worry about studying abroad it's like
"
570,SP1,"uh a definitely language problems cause although I might study one two three four That doesn't mean like it's gonna help me in the daily conversations
"
571,SP2,"Yeah
"
572,SP2,"Yeah yeah
"
573,SP1,"Still so is the same thing cause we we took English classes back in China but those classes don't necessarily prepare you for English conversations
"
574,SP2,"Yeah that's fair
"
575,SP1,"like
"
576,SP1,"Yeah so like it's only test prep
"
577,SP2,"It's different
"
578,SP2,"yeah
"
579,SP1,"yeah
"
580,SP2,"But the good thing also about studying abroad is that like once you get there by the time you leave you're gonna be so good at conversation
"
581,SP1,"mm
"
582,SP2,"cause you'll only be speaking for the most part in that language for a good chunk of your time for an entire semester
"
583,SP1,"mm
"
