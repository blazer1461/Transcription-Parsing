I can hear your mouth noises
I can hear your mother noises cause you're making though on purpose really loudly
this is literally so bizarre cause it looks like a mirror like it would
yeah I feel like it t like be a mirror
like
I know it's like
Anyway
This is like we're in jail so which one of us is in jail and which one of us is visiting the other
I mean realistically it's probably like I end up in jail
For what
I don't know
Like tax fraud
Yeah
cause you'd you doctor you forget accidentally
it would be like an accident yeah
I would definitely go to jail accidentally like I wouldn't purposely like rob someone but I would like trip and bump into someone and they like hurt themselves
and then sue me
Yeah
No yeah that would probably happen to me like I could definitely see
you're like think you're just at like normal hang outs
I'm like oh shit I already committed
Yeah and you would
Can't ditch now
You wouldn't commit all the way
yeah I don't know I don't know
hm
but I have a pretty strong moral compass
Cookie
well okay cool
um
Anyway
What would you go to prison for
stop it
um
I don't even know I feel like
Like manslaughter but like where it's accidental
like what degree
Like the lowest one but I'd just like accidentally kill someone
Okay
which would suck
that'd really be a bummer
That's like my greatest fear
like actually it kind
Okay so I always like tweek out like have you heard of the butterfly effect
coughs
I used to tweek out like what if like something I did once like caused the death of someone else and I don't even know
yeah
Definitely
definitely
like
Isn't that kinda trippy
Yeah I'm afraid when I'm driving that I'm gonna hit someone with my car
Yeah and since I'm I'm not a good driver so
I know that
Yeah
you hit everyone
No I don't I haven't hit a single person I hit everything
yeah true but like when you're driving fast you're like if someone just like walked in front of my car
they would die and like there's nothing you can do about it
like literally you could like go to jail
like which would be a bummer
That would be a bummer
do you ever find it weird how like all the time in class
Sommers is like yeah like this is completely confidential like they don't know any information about you except for your number and then you get there and every times it's like participant name

My like punching code for like
Everything is still my um school lunch number from elementary school

Really
Yeah there is like two families with the last name Leighann
the Leighann is really like they are certain towns
Really
that's a fact there's like I can't remember what town it is now wait
I don't remember but there's like a building with Leighann on it
really
Oh the one who owned the Um kosher deli

No
oh
cause that's Ye the Yarliss side
Oh got it got it I've never met a Laliberte that's not related
yeah I can imagine what's that from
It's La Liberte which is French means the free
woah
no big deal
Are you French
I am half French half Italian
That's pretty cool
You wouldn't know though cause I don't look either I just look white but
Um yeah you got it
coughs
I don't wanna cough into your ear it's too intimate it's like
fake cough for demonstration
yeah that's actually not like intimate that's just disgusting
mouth smacking
this is intimate
more mouth smacking
wait where is it
wait where is my mike
no it's just
ASMR with Molly Leliberty
today we're gonna be drinking water
yeah It works
That's funny
I do feel like a Broadway star that they always have these like
They always have the yeah the like
right here
yellowish ones yeah when I did my my um my one play
woah okay
What did something happen
No I said woah okay like
Yeah
m Big star over here
you know kind of big deal did one play um it was like ten minutes long um
Yeah I was the star though
But we didn't get mikes so I just had to shout
just project
I'm good at projecting my voice though I don't think anyone's
Yeah that's true
I agree woah we have the same plant and picture
No Way that's really true I think that's why It should be a mirror
That's why it literally looks like a
When I walked I was like fully tripping up it's
o you think we're allowed to use our phones I wanna take a
Yeah
alright
see
it's funny
what time is it
It's nine forty one
What we've been talking for ten minutes
wait what
It's only been ten minutes
It's only been ten minutes that's alright
we shouldn't have talked on the way over
I know
it's a long walk
it's a long walk
Let's talk about a thing
Lacrosse
we're wearing the same
We're both wearing Tufts lacrosse shirts
fucker
do you play lacrosse
All the time
what's what's your favorite part about lacrosse
uh
Friendship
That was like the corniest answer ever
friendship
slurps
mine too
Oh I heard that
did you like
what
oh
Oh that was terrible
Nope
couldn't hear that
I got a little one on this one
Oh yeah
Oh that sounds so nice oh that one those were good
doing the same thing
wait that's the wrong hand shit
I should've done something the other ear so it was like
A mirror image
just like
imagine being wait she hear us whether we whisper or not
that's true you're whispering into a microphone
but like
just like she just like looks on the fucking screen like
Um my favorite part of lacrosse is when I stuff the shit out of you um
Oh
Yeah
You mean never that's I'm sorry you must hate lacrosse
Yeah that's uh that's why I'm actually thinking about quitting
Woah
What are you woahing
May is bringing another person to dinner
Who
Her brother
I might also bring my brother to dinner
We can just leave him in the car
true
I'm not bringing my brother I think my brother has soccer today um he's the team manager uh
So basically he's not athletic enough to like
o h
Yeah
woah
it's tough he got cut he tried out but you know if he had stuck with soccer the whole time like he was wicked good in middle school
yeah
then he quit in high school and like senior year he's like yeah I'm gonna try out f or soccer again like yeah good move bud
My dad's been saying for legit years he should've stuck with soccer
mimicking dad
he should've stuck with soccer
mimicking dad
But yeah he ha he has fun doing it now
so
mm
feel like this is gonna be like a thing like she was using her phone like
Yeah No that's definitely going to be a part
How do they social interact
and then it's going to be like talking about like how the conversation kind of like lulled for a sec when you went on your phone
but No
but no Picking it right back up
but it's not gonna lull
greatest fear
my greatest fear
real talk
yeah
Like the fact that like we have no control over anything ever and like we can like
like we can like say like oh like I care about this so much like oh this is so important but like at the end of the day we're all just gonna be like a speck of nothingness on the entire line of human existence and human existence itself is probably gonna be a tiny little
spot on the entire universe which what the fuck is the universe we can s̲pend our days praying to a god and even if that god's real doesn't fucking matter ccause we're all just gonna die anyway
whoa I would say mine is
so yeah that's my greatest fear
I think
and throwing up
You're like that and bears
I gotta knock on wood a desk gotta knock on wood
so you don't throw up
ye b̲ears
no I was joking
oh
Um it's a
Not really a fear but like that does kind of freak me out like
It's so trippy
yeah like
like
Well why do we like
like what's the fucking point
Like why do we
like adhere to these like societal norms like why are we nice to people why like was what's the point because we're just gonna
Well that's my question we're we're just animals like what like why am I
Like why do I feel the need to like what does it matter if I like am nice to somebody
Exactly and like there's like I I don't I guess I don't real ly know
but I am like I have to be
what like a sociopath really is but like when you think a like a sociopath that's like
Someone who like
just a normal thing like that shit you know like
It's just like someone someone who's like a sociopath just like
Doesn't like have like empathy or whatever but like
yeah
We don't like foster empathy completely ever like aren't we all little bit sociopathic like you can say like oh like I feel bad but like
It's like
Yeah yeah we we're h we're here having a deep conversation about like the universe and fucking
sorry but um but whatevs
it's okay I'll get over it
you're gonna hear it blows nose mm nice
there we go oh shit
um
it's like the
Something else I find interesting is like why do we
Isn't it weird that when you're born you're immediately like in
Like how you the government can just send you to prison like you never agreed to be part of the society does that make sense
Yeah
they like well
You're like forced to be in
There's this whole like idea of like the social contract and like the consent of the governed but literally like by being born for eighteen years you have like
No consent
There's no way to just live free like truly
But like would we want to is the thing
Oh no
I don't t hink so but I just think it's f Like
Like
like It's crazy to think about
And it's really weird to think that there's like really not that much that separates us from
Any other animal so why do we think we're so much like different
cause we got the brains
well but that's my thing like why do we think that everything animals do is just like animalistic and purely evolutionary but then everything we do is somehow different
yeah
Like I don't wanna say like everything in like psychology and shit can be explained by like the like evolutionary like
Yeah
View point but like
Yeah
e I don't know I'm just in intro to psych
what do I know
true
true
just ask Lis Lisa
yeah we should get Lisa in here
we should get
Lisa
what if Lisa sees this footage because she's a researcher
Lisa we love you
Lisa we love you
um
More than Sam sorry Sam
I like Sam
I like Sam a lot
It's funny cause they're like both good
They're both great
And I some some days I need Sam
Some days I need Sam
honest
somedays I need a little little joke like
Yeah no and like Lisa does joke
Lisa definitely does
and she shows great video clips
great Videos
Honestly both of them do
Both of them do
I think they both make the slides
yeah they might do it together that's really great collaboration
I think they know how to break it up
on their part
by giving us like clips
I I completely agree
And also it is helpful like it it's a good example
I was fucking dying laughing in class the other day it was
Somers mike fell
oh yeah
and he was just like
oo
yeah
Anyway Lisa if you're watching and you'd like to give us tips on how to do your ha on do our hair
Like your hair
Like your hair feel free to forward that information along
just like write in on the back of my next test
Molly dot oh shit did I put the dot
I don't know if I wrote my email correctly on the form
it's probably okay
bu
This equipment is so high teck
It really is like I feel like like like this is definitely much more legit than the one of the other ones I went to
what
it was so dumb
which one did you do
so I did this one
And basically so we had to watch a silent film
And then we had to listen to an audio that described the silent film but they weren't like exactly the same
then I had to play Tetris for awhile which it was my first time ever playing Tetris can you believe that
I played so much I played so much Tetris growing up
I was nineteen and I had never played Tetris
Anyway and then I had to like answer questions but the questions could only be based on the audio
Like if it was something that we knew I knew happened in the film like I wasn't sure if it happened in the audio too I just
Had to say I didn't know
And the like after that we had to like answer questions about the differences between the film and the audio
And it took like an hour and a half and it was just like so stupid and then like I found out I was the control so like m that's why it was so stupid like and like the actual ones like they see how you do like under stress or whatever so like
yeah
It's um like
like you you could do it like like one thing that they did was like they put your hand in ice water
oh
Which
That would be kinda stressful to me I don't like that
Yeah I'm I'm usually the control
like I've always like
I've only ever been the control
Yeah I'm always like wow this is dumb and then I'm like oh it' s because normally they there's like a point to it
Yeah this s th s a change
or some shit
I a
I did
but
one where like all of them up until now I've just been sitting in front of a computer
same this is my first one thats not just like
Yeah
Yeah yeah there's one I was like
Given a monologue to memorize and I like obviously you're not gonna memorize it but
Come on aren't you a woman of the stage now
Well not memorize
you have to like read it four times and then you like answer questions about something and then you have to stand up in front of a camera and like read it again
So bizarre
like out loud
Yeah and it was supposed to be like the character was
Oh
interesting
It was cool
do you feel like
Any like internalized like
no
This some deep down like that's not what I'm trying to say but like you know how like like me like I grew up like just like surrounded
By white people so like I guess I wouldn't like know
if I had been doing something that's not right my whole life like you know I mean like
yeah
yeah
Not
Not trying to but like
Yeah
H it could happen
Yeah
that's like
that's why I kinda like feel bad when like celebrities get like um canceled like you know what I mean like
cause they
well the problem is like
Is that
Ignorance is not necessarily intentional and yet it is like pretty toxic
Oh yeah I think it's absolutely toxic
s
I think the people who do nothing are just as bad as the people out there with like fucking hoods on
so it's
but like sometimes
but like sometimes I get what you're saying because sometimes ignorance is like sometimes ignorance I think is um
Bad like why haven't you like educated yourself but also sometimes ignorance is just like people can't help like the people they grow up around
Right
so like
A lot of times pe people get in trouble for saying like faggot when they were like
I hate that
I hate that so much so much
I hate that word so much when people say that I hate that but I didn't if you say the F word people don't know what you're talking about
Yeah I know
mm
if I try to specify a bit
w
I feel like they're gonna be like wow look at these um homophobes
no if y
no um
okay um but like
that like they said that when they were like eighteen
Yeah
where everyone's white or and ev or everyone's straight
Everyone's straight
and like they don't know anything
like that they surrounded by Heteronormativity
and they just say that stuff
Yeah so it's like
when you're a kid like it's harder to not be ignorant
but then when you're older but they get trouble for
Well yeah
That's what I'm saying I think it's sad when like people don't have an opportunity to change cause like not everybody is brought up like just being taught the right thing
And like not everybody grows up n like I literally like
I maybe like knew like on more than just like a oh I know who this person is I literally knew on like a personal level maybe like
Two people of color before I came tufts like I'm not exaggerating
wow
like Newburyport is so
That's crazy
Homogeneous it's it's really crazy
But
wow
Yeah but I mean like obviously I'm the type of person who like is Like liberal
Yeah
so like I'm gonna
That's crazy
like educate myself and shit but like
Yeah
Yeah so
You know but like there's like like this one kid in my town
And he's like he's been one of my best friends since I was
Younger and he's
Like
Straight rich white whatever it like stereotypical Newburyport boy and like
Yeah
He's like the type of kid who like thought it would be like thought it's like okay like make fun of the kids with special needs are like
Yeah
Say like gay as an insult and shit like that and like
Do you remember when I posted on my um insta story like of the canon it's so like we believe survivors the canon here
I'm never on your insta
true true
I literally only go on insta
But I do remember the cannons
but yeah the canna s canon said we believe survivors
Yeah
and so
I like put that on my story and he like slid up on it and he was like I survived a tornado once I was like what I was like what you talking about like why are you even like saying this and and he was like well l you're saying you believe survivors so I'm telling you my stories I go like this isn't like funny this isn't like something to joke about he's like wait no like I seriously don't get it and I was like this I'm speaking about sexual assault and rape like how we believe females when they tell their stories and males too
yeah
and Anyone really and he was like oh shit like I didn't
what
like what have you been doing but it kinda just like shows how like
Privilege can like lead to ignorance cause like he didn't feel the need to tune into the fact that a rapist is gonna be on the Supreme Court cause why does he care he's
yeah
It doesn't really affect him
It doesn't affect him
yeah he'll have rights no matter what
exactly no one's taking away rights from
white men with money
that's wild
mm
Yeah anyways it's been awhile since I talked about politics since uh
You know like me and Monica don't really talk about politics
but yeah
Is she like
Not liberal or whatever
She's registered as a Republican
But like socially
but like
so yeah she's like socially liberal but that's like kind of I kind of have a problem with people who are like just socially liberal cause like
In the US like nothing's going to change without money and like
A lot of the times
They play into each other like people of color are not just oppressed socially they're opressed like financially
Yeah
Because of a lot of the social obstacles in place and so like for someone to be like
Socially liberal but still like wicked fiscally conservative just kinda like shows like
yeah
You
Like it's like you're aware that you have privilege and you're like oh that kinda sucks but you don't really want to change it
Yeah
Like
makes sense
you know what I'm saying like so that just like kinda rubs me the wrong way but like she's super like open and accepting I mean I haven't really asked if she's like fiscally conservative I just know  I remember she mentioned she  registered Republican and
She but she also has told me that she is like like social issues a very accepting stuff like that so I don't know that I don't know
didn't she put on her um
like roommate thing
two point five
out of ten
yeah
maybe she thought it was the other way
No
Yeah so that's definitely
Not uh something I'm looking forward to
But yeah I don't know maybe she just like I don't know wanted someone like
normal
mm yeah
like you know I mean like you get some like weirdpeople and
yeah that makes sense
but yeah I just don't know we got put together because I think
it's
Yeah
I don't know
Just weird
yeah
this is so funny
This is a funny way to have a conversation
I feel like a telemarketer or something I'm trying to like sell you something
is this like this like looks like a mirror but like it's not
No it's but like you're not me so
but like it looks like a mirror oh okay this is so strange
This is really weir I thought there was just like nothing here or something I don't know
All right
This is like weird okay
what are we going to talk about today
I don't know I don't know anything
tell me about your day
H
okay so I woke up a ki like three like twenty minutes before I had work and I was like oh my gosh and then yeah I just went to work and then I got lunch and now I'm here
Exciting
Very exciting
sounds like a very exciting day
very uneventful
I woke up at like noon it was it was the right way to do things
Yeah I like a regularly woke up at like eight and I was like no no no no like
N
I only went to bed four hours ago
like this is not happening and then I went back to sleep
Yeah I don't know I feel I need to like catch up on sleep a lot I think on It was Thursday night I got to bed before midnight for the first time in like a month
mhm
and it was it felt really nice
Me too
yeah no like okay here's my problem like this whole past week I could have gone to bed at ten PM if I wanted to and I was like okay lik I'm gonna go to bed
So why didn't you
I don't think I'm telling I was a I I I'm gonna go to bed at ten PM I have to wake up at like like eight fifty lik I'm going to be so like c like caught up on sleep and then like you're just T too for just talks a lot
Yea
So I just get stuck talkin
I
Sorry about that
No it's fine I just like talk to I like talk to one person and end up talking to seven people then before I know it's like three in the morning
Yeah when I hear like there a lot of noise out there I just feel the need to like drop whatever I'm doing and like go out
Yeah yeah
I feel like I get like major FOMO I'm like they're talking without me
They're talking they're having a good time
I'm like like how can I just sit here doing homework
when they're talking so then I just go outside and talk
I know yeah
I hate I I I hate it because like I have some I need to do spend so much time doing homework but like I c I keep feeling like I'm missing out if I'm like doing it
it's really it's really rough
I I like it can't get over the setting this is really funny
This is wait we have like the same painting too
oh my god and it's like Directly it's like directly flipped
and the same tree and like that
Although my my my light is like more wide open
oh that's true maybe like that's why the it looks like like a mirror image cause like
it cause it's literally the exact same
It's literally yeah it's just flipped
That's so weird I'm actually really tripped up by this
Even we have like the same tree too
we have the same tree the same curtains can i Can I just like I can like close it on you
well you have the table
Yeah that's true that's so er I'm like I'm I'm just like thrown by this that's all
Oh my god yeah
s
I wonder how many times they will like get a conversation that's like really self aware of the fact that they're in the study
prolly like every single time right
Yeah I feel like I feel like every conversation probably has some discussion about that
Yeah it's
cause it's like Like how do you not pay attention to the setting
Yeah especially like Tufts students too they like to pick apart everything
cause we're quirky
we're so quirky
We're the quirkiest
oh my god
this setting is quirky
This is a very quirky setting I like the painting though it's very pretty
Yeah
It's like the snow on it and everything
Yeah
Makes me want to go skiing
It makes me feel very relaxed
yeah I don't know it's like
and like it also ma̲kes me w̲ant to like have like
mm
oh my god that's w̲hy I like the r̲ain so much
Yeah
Like it doesn't rain a lot in Califo̲rnia̲ and it's always like
I wish
Theres n̲o̲ fires̲ at Tufts̲ and it really pisses me off
There's t̲o̲o many fir̲es in California
No like fire like firepla̲ces
oh yeah I haven't seen a single o̲ne
Yeah I know
do any of like the cook I mean I guess it would be like a fire hazard
Why
cause we're a bunch of eighteen year olds playing with fire
What they put a fireplace in my high school
Really
yeah
What kind of high schol did you go to
and that was a bunch of fourteen to eighteen year olds
I went to I went to a weird high school it was like a it was a real techy [ ] high school
my god
but There was a fire place there
Damn
and it was very cozy to like sit by there
Damn
But then people would turn it on in the spring and it would be like really hot
and people would be like why the fuck what why would you do that
Oh my god
that'd be a good like senior
I feel like I should not cuss at the in this thing
No man go for it
I realize that
No but like I I don't know I don't want to like I gotta keep I got to keep it campy I I can't like I can't be like I I don't know I just feel like they don't want that kind of
Yeah did you guys have a senior prank in high school
oh we did
oh we did
We we tried like cause every year they have one that we tried so hard to do one but like people's ideas they so weird your so illegal like someone was like cause we have um like the faculty parking and we have like a student parking lot so people were like oh let's like park all the cars in the faculty parking lot but like I don't want to get my car towed
Yeah I know def
And then like another idea was like all it's have like like a purge in the school but my high school's seventh through twelfth grade
Oh god no you can't do that
So you have twelve year olds in my school
Yeah no that's bad
and I'm like I'm not about to scare a bunch of twelve year olds
Yeah I'm not I'm not messing with that
Yeah and then another idea was like like a splish like a splush not specialist slip and slide through the hallway
oo that's a that's a good one
and like that
but like that's also like like we would flood the whole school
That's really annoying to clean up
Yeah and like the whole school would be flooded
cause like Our building is like kind of old
We d
We did like a lot of things for our senior prank we did li um one of the big ones was was so we have like our high school and then like a twenty minute drive away there's like the m the accompanying middle school
mhm
So these two these se these senior basically piled in a car Went to the middle school kidnapped a metal dinosaur
oh my god
that they had in the middle school and drove it all the way back
oh my god
So this giant metal dinosaur is just in the middle of the hallway
I I love that
which is
It was really great
Um
And then there was like a lot of confetti and balloons just like all over the place
that's cool
And they took like our um our pictures and they like cut them up and like put them all over the campus in like these little like tiny paper flakes basically so they're still like finding them
mhm
to this day
Oh my god that's so funny
Yeah
One year they had they like greased all the locks
so no one could no one could like open their locker
oh no
One year they put like a rat in the bathroom which was just just like  disgusting
Why would you do that
that's so terrible
and like this one kid was like like Meyer he was oh let's have a turtle race in the hallway I'm like that's not funny
That's ju that's just like crappy like
that that's just like
Also like what are you gonna do with the turtles after like j
ju
just like
Do you got a hold on them for the rest of the school day yeah
Yeah
yea
d
no one no one had like any like good ideas oh my god wait we had a thing called road rally
Road rally
Yes so it's like very like secretive just because it's like it has to be low key cause it's all legal
oh
So
Is it like drag ra please tell me it's not drag racing
it could be if okay so basically like the winners of the year before they choose like the judges for the next year and then the so how it works is like you have like teams
Okay
um and each team has to have a designated driv erSo you have like teams and then you like people name it something punny based off like alcohol like someone did like like tequila a mockingbird
Oh my god
Yeah and then like the teams like they put everyone pays like every team I htink pays like twenty dollars
um
Okay
Towards its like one pool of money and then it's like one like a random Friday or Saturday night for like no like no one knows the day that it is until like two days before just cause it has to be like so low key

m yeah
Yeah
Yeah it's literally just that
yeah
You guys literally just did nerve
well we had this before nerve so nerve
Nerve did your thing
Nerve did our thing
That's wi that was what you did in high school
as seniors
Well I didn't do it I did not do it cause I would never participate like is it's just it's insane
Yeah that's crazy
and like it's so It's so dangerous
I couldn't imagine my classmates doing that
cause it's like um like drive down like a local street eighty miles per hour like you could kill someone
Yeah you could kill someone doing that but wow that's why
Yeah
that's really wild
I am like I'm like I am never part like it's just so da l ike if you wanna like par like first participa like participate in that go ahead but like there's some things that just like put other people's lives at risk which I'm like I'm not okay with at all
Yeah no I'm not messing with that
Like us like if you want to do your own thing fine but like driving down a local street eighty miles per hour like you could actually kill someone and yourself
Yea
and everyone else in the carand everyone else in the car
Yeah that's really crazy I at my high school never did anything that to that level
it's it's so so insane
For our senior prank we also we took balloons we fill we got water balloons and we put them on like the th the third floor balcony over the main entrance and whenever
I I th I think you told me this
Yeah we we yeah we would like bombard everyone who came by
Yea
it was really good
Yeah
Like w like a group of like kids come from the train station and we just like rained down water balloons on all of them
oh my g wait did that on the last day of school
Really
Like after like on like the lass day of school when everyone was like leaving at like three PM there'd be a bunch of seniors like the entire like class just like hiding behind bushes cause we would just like throw them at cars throw them at people yeah
and this year we had to be more like low key about it though cause there's always like cop cars around
Yea
on like the last day of school
Just like trying to like look for people to give tickets to and stuff like that
yeah
It was really funny I was v
I was walking back from school once with one of my friends and we found um and like one of us is that and we found the a frisbee just sort of lying on the on the side of the road so we grabed the frisbee and I ran over to the other side of the road and we started throwing it across
Oh my god
And so like I threw like a nice throw and at him he catches it and then he's like winding up to throw it he like do you like to takes a couple steps forward and then this cop car out of nowhere just pulls up in front of him and the cops just got his window open he's about to throw it and he's just like I wouldn't do that if I were you son
And then just walk a
Oh my god
Just like drives away and he that he looks so shook it was really funny
on the last day of school of my my friend was driving me home well no we weren't going home we were getting like ice cream or something but um she was driving me and and my best friend so like we got in the car we start to drive she stops at a stop sign and then a cop pulls over the cop so you need to stop at stop signs and we were all like we did like we literally made a full stop at the stop sign he's like no you did it and I'm like
made a California stop
like like a full like break stop cause like we were we were off to good be saved but just like the cop was there
Yea
Like it wasn't even like a slowdown go it was a full stop and he was like you have to stop and we're like we  we we did [ ]
We did
like we literally did
what happened did he give you a ticket
no he was just like just for next time like you need to stop we were like
yikes
We did though
I've I knew like three friends who got called to traffic court because they got caught caught uh going like running stop signs
oh my g I ran a red light once by accident cause like I was
Just by accident
I was driving to a graduation party and also this is in queens which is New York City so like it was even worse
Hello yeah
that's crazy yeah
like I was driving to a graduation party and I was just so anxious about something so do I want to drive and you kinda just zone out for a little bit
mhm
like so like I was zoned out and I ran a red light and I was just really scared but
yikes
I We're all good didn't get a ticket
All good didn't get a ti that's yeah I'd be terrified if that happened
I was so scared and like I'm not like I don't know if I don't know if I'm allowed to say this
Uh um
I don't
it's not like not my car it's my dad's car also so like it's
It's fine I I it it's it's it's in the past now it doesn't matter
Yeah yeah
they aren't gonna like
yeah it was like It was a July a like
They aren't gonna like a
Yeah they aren't gonna like take this recording and send it to like the queens police and be like hey we got someone for you
it's
I they they aren't gonna do that don't worry
and okay I think like at that time all like the speed cameras and like the red light cameras like there weren't working because um they were like fixing them or they were like people on strike or something so the cameras just weren't functioning
So it was
Okay
I don't it was strange
But that's that's weird sorry I
but
Didn't didn't get a ticket so
If I tap this is it like really loud I don't know that's fine it doesn't sound like anything
wait tap yours
No it just is just sounds like a ch ch ch
Yeah that's all
Yeah
oh my gosh
this is This is I'm like hyper aware of the fact that this is here
I I don't know well now I'm aware of it because you mentioned but I wasn't before
it's it's it's weird
The friend I'm meeting tonight for dinner um he's a really crazy driver he would he he would drive me to school a lot we'd like carpool and he'd always be the one driving and he drives just like a little Chevy bolt
It's like a it's a pretty small car
Yeah
it's like it's like kind of a Prius but they like compressed it and it like went one up as a result
mhm
like on the on Photoshop you like to drag the box in and it like extends out on the top
So like a
That's basically what the car is
so does it look like a box
It's kind of like a box it kinda looks like a computer mouse honestly
e ugh
And he it's a fine car though it's act I like I love driving it
Yeah
and
yeah
It's got like really good acceleration and really good handling So
and it it's the single most terrifying thing to experience
mhm
Oh my god
cause I'm sitting in the front and like all of a sudden he'll just like floor it and go like ninety miles an hour c like go ahead of this one car and then like change lanes again and that I got like so numb to it by the end I would like sit in I be like sitting in the front and he be doing it
oh my god
And like another friend will be sitting in the back and they'd be like clenching their seat really freaked out and I just feel like ho hum
Wait how far were you from your high school where you had to use the highway
It was a twenty minute drive we used to take the train
Really
yeah
oh damn
um in freshman sophomore and part of junior year I would take the train every single day
mhm
um
And yeah it would like it that was like a that was like a twenty minute train ride um and then once like everyone got like cars they could drive and got a license um we started car pooling and stuff
mhm
But by by the end of it I started driving myself cause it was really relaxing to be able to like listen to my own music
Yea
and everything on the highway
that's true
yeah I know mine was like a five minute drive but um yeah I would just like have my mom drive me um and then like when I got my license I would like drive myself
Yeah my my parents never drove me cause my dad was busy and my mom doesn't drive on highways
Yeah
yeah yeah we didn't even need highways but it was like it kind of sucked cause I wasn't able to drive all the time cause like I didn't have my own car I'd have my dad's car so I can like only like use it if my mom wasn't working and then my dad would take her van and I would take my dad's car
So that and that was the only thing that worked
Yeah
I m so
Yeah
uh yeah I have like the a car that was like designated for like me and my brother even though anyone in the family would drive it
mhm
and um my brother couldn't drive it until like the summer But once he could it got really annoying cause I just wouldn't have the car available
Yea
and like in the summer it was like senior year it was like the summer after senior year So I was doing like the most driving and I was going to like the most places I'd ever like gone to before So it was like it was really annoying where I'd be like oh yeah I'm trying to go to like this friend's house this afternoon my mom's like na my brother your brother took it to football
That that's what happened to me cause like my dad was gonna get um a new car and then his current car was gonna become mine and my brothers and like we ended up going to Europe so then we like like that money was spent on Europe but um yeah like like the whole summer I would be like oh like I need the car and then my brother would be like oh like I'm taking it
No I need it this is my car
and I was like no and like it sucked cause like he was older than me so he like he did get priority
That's annoying
and I was like ugh yeah
I don't know now now like most of my friends just drive
it's it's fine
Yeah and like I had a I had a lot of friends who like had their own cars they were just drive me places
Yeah I feel like most people in New York don't really drive around though most of the people I've talked to haven't really like gotten their licenses
It it depends where you're from like from the city like there's no point if you're from the city there's really no point in getting your license
cause you're not gonna drive in the city but like Long Island like
Yea
But like it's good to have your license
Yea
Sooner rather than later
Yeah like everyone in Long Island has their license
Yeah driving w driving on like the highways is like definitely like one of my favorite things to do
Yeah yeah
And like in California there's this one highway where it's it's like runs all it's sort of like runs through these like hills and it's really beautiful
mhm
and there's like fog rolling over them and everything so it's just like a really cool place to drive in
Yeah
like you can go really fast there cause there's like There's no cars
Yeah
and also there's no cops so you can go like way faster and they don't really care
Um so
Yeah yeah yeah I know it's definitely rela relaxing but like the only time I would really go no the highway is like driving from like driving to and from work I would use the highway and then like if I would just go to Jersey with my parents I would drive on the highway
You'd do the driving for that
Yeah well I would drive home cause usually my dad would be like um going there we'd have like we have to be there by a certain time so I'll drive but it's like stressful at night
oh definitely
Like because it
night driving on the highway with a lot of cars around is really stressful
yea
it's like it would always like make me really anxious and it would take me like half an hour until like I got the hang of it
Yea
Yeah
But like usually I'll just drive on local roads cause I never really like needed the highway
we w
Now it's far we would drive up to we drive up to lake taho whole lot
mhm
and the dri like the first half is just like long boring highway driving
Yeah
But the second half is like really windy like two lane highways with a lot of like giant trucks and it's like really sketchy
mhm
like you've got a wall on one side and like a cliff on the other it's like really freaky
Yeah
And um like I I learned how to do that driving eventually and it was it's you need to be like focused and locked in like twenty four seven when you're doing that
yeah and like I just like I tend to like zone out when I'm driving it either like I like pay attention to music or I'll just like relax too much
Yeah I can't do that
So like highway driving like I'm like I need to pay attention to everything happening
mhm And when you're doing it at night you like get you get drowsy
Yeah yea
so like my dad like he like n he never really let me drive on the highway unless he was with me or if my mom was with me like I wouldn't be allowed to drive on the highway by myself
I think the DMV called it like highway hypnosis or something like that I don't even know I don't even know why I still remember that
That makes
that makes sense that makes a lot of sense yeah I like don't understand how people Iike still don't have their licenses I literally got mine like the week after I turned sixteen
Really
well I didn't get my license I got my learner's permit like the week after I turned sixteen and then I took my road test when I was seventeen
I think I got I got my permit um about when I was sixteen when when did I get my permit
Yeah
Yeah I got my permit like a decent amount of time after I was sixteen and I started taking lessons and then
um When did I fini when did I pass my te
You can you can take your uh you can get you license at sixteen in California
Yeah
Oh my god
it really do be like that
In New York it's like you can get your permit at sixteen and and then um
Fifteen and a half in California
oh my god
It's nice
that is insane
I actually failed my permit test the first time
That's insane
Which is dumb cause it's the written test it's like so easy and I just bombed it
the first time
Oh my god yeah for us it's like when you're sixteen you can get your permit and then when you're seventeen you can take your road test but it's either like you have to have your permit for six months o
Yeah I know it's
Or you have to be seventeen
Yeah
And then you get your juniors license
You have a junior's li
But
oh no there's the provisional license
Yeah
yeah
so you get like your juniors license which is like you can drive alone to and from school and work everywhere else you have to have someone who is twenty one
oh really
Yeah
Ours is li but the professional licenses uh I think you have to I think learner's permit is you have to drive with someone
Yeah
so that you can be that you could be doing that as soon as you're fifteen and a half
mhm
Then you have provisional license where I think you can't drive other people and you have to be you can't be driving between um eleven PM and six AM
For New York it's five no
Nine PM to five AM
you can't you can't drive
Nine
That's harsh
By yourself well you yeah you can drive but also like that's like just Long Island like New York City's so much more restrictive
I I mean I can imagine
Yeah
it's crazy there
and then like when you're eighteen you get your
It's like mostly taxis
Yeah you get your full license when you're eighteen or if you get your drivers license when you're seventeen but then you take driver's ed no okay wait if you take driver's ed and then take a road test you get your full license even if you're seventeen but I didn't take driver's ed cause like I would only have my juniors lessons for like three months and then like or like six months then I would get my full license so I'm like I can wait it out six months like I'm not gonna pay like four hundred dollars for it
for drivers ed
Yea
yeah it's not really worth
Yeah there's like so many stages and like I think what they're learner's permit like you have to be with a parent or a guardian you can drive within certain hours
mhm
and then junior's license you can only have like one other random person in the car um you have you can only drive alone to and from school and work and you have to everywhere else you have to have like an someone who's twenty one or over
no
driving just like having the the freedom to drive and like Junior year was like the nicest thing ever
Yeah it was and like no one really like enforced the whole junior license thing so even if like
If
oh
I would just drive alone everywhere like no one cause like it was just wasn't enforced but it was so nice like cause also we had like the senior privilege which is like during um you could just leave campus during your free periods
Oh my gosh yeah off campus
Yeah you get you can like go out for food
that was literally the best
or just like well anytime during your free lunch bridge you can just leave campus
Yeah
and like It was so nice
that's what we did all the time senior year
just like driving to like Panera or something
Yeah I know my friend would literally just like he'd like pile us on in his like little Chevy bowl and we'd all drive to like a burger place
with my friends
yeah
or we we would go into like downtown like Sam Matteo which is like where our school is near and we'd get like full on like ramen meals
Yea
mhm
there was like this really good burger place
oh my god
What was it called it was called like I've I forget the name of the burger place but it was really really good and we just get like all this really good food
Yeah
all the time and I went really broke and gained a lot of weight it was great
yeah me too it was just so nice just like being able to like leave and just get away from everythin and like like forget that like you're stuck in this building
Well second semester senior year is just like it's just like a nonstop vacation honestly
Yeah yeah that's true that's true like second semes second semester's just like whatever but first semester is actually really hard for me like it was just so much
First semester was rough
It was
cause I was like I was applying to this place
yeah and college apps and also like just so much homework
I was applying to Tufts
I had so much homework
There was a lot of work yeah
And I was like what the hell like everyone said senior year is supposed to be fun and easy but like it didn't get
Second semester is
it didn't get fun for me until like February
Yeah what did you do like ED or did you do
no
no
you did regular
regular
So you're like done with your applications by February
December f thirty first is when I finished cause I promised myself I'm not taking college apps in twenty eighteen
Yeah
Yeah
that was a good idea
but then even then like I was like a yearbook editor and like I my schools yearbook is like hardcore
That's that sounds stressful yeah
Like it's hard core and we had like so many deadlines to meet and like
I was
yearbook is tough it demands a lot
Yeah and like my advisers is very like he like expects a lot from us just cause like our book is so like well known everything so it's like you can't like slack off
mm
and like a few
What was it called
Um it's called lance
Lance okay
I may have I honestly may have heard of that cause my I did journalism
But
Are you serious
and uh in senior year and like our teacher was also the yearbook teacher
oh my god
and she knew like a lot of different yearbooks and stuff like that I don't know
I've heard of some it sounds like really vaguely familiar I don't know
You've heard of your
oh My god maybe if I'll like show you
Maybe yeah
like
Yeah maybe a little bit yeah um yeah and like it was just like so demanding and like if you like slack off then you're like it's not even just like oh like if you slack off it it affects you like it affects everyone
you'll show me a later yeah
mhm We yeah no it it yeah it's a lot
Yea
it's definitely like a very demand like
yeah
My friend was like one of the big editors on it and she even in second semester was like really stressed all the time
Yeah I literally would like spend all my free time just like editing spreads
Yeah
and just like yeah
I dropped Spanish second semester senior year and it was the best decision of my life
I didn't even take Spanish I was gonna take AP Spanish but it was the same like like block as AP art and like not taking AP art wasn't an option for me like I'd I wanted to take it
mhm
so I didn't even take Spanish during my senior year
Yeah I just made sure to take like the chillest classes in second semester
mhm
and it it was worth it
oh my god Every other day I like every day I had like one lunch period but every other day I had like one class and then a free period two classes lunch two classes free period one class and then I'd go home so it was like I would do like very minimal work and then get like forty five minutes just chill and do nothing
Oh my gosh
Like every other like that was every other day and it was just so amazing
Yeah there were like there was like one day I think it was honestly Fridays where we could just go off campus and because like most of us had a free period we'd just like stay off campus
like There was this guy's apartment that we just went to and we would just like play video games up there for like straight up like two hours
Yeah
Yeah this girl I know she had like cause you have nine periods a day she like three four five six all free at the same time
oh my gosh
like All together so she would like go home and like take a nap
That sounds amazing
and like just like she have like two hours to herself
Yeah I would just like wait I would wake up late on like multiple days
like all the time and just like drive to school like in an hour later than I was supposed to because of free period and everything
mm
I had AP chem first period every day
it was The nicest thing
So
Okay that's not so fun
yeah eight AM AP chem and like the reason they have like very year it's always first periood just so like you can get it over with
Yeah I I do like the idea of getting it over with
cause like it's it's yeah like if it was ninth period I would absolutely die
I would be dead at that point
is Just too much
That's just really rough
cause like that class like kills your soul
I'm so glad our schedule is like built in the in the way it is in college
Yeah
it's like
like I like being in like control of my own time and being able to like choose when I do things
mm
and when I don't do things
Yeah it's like I don't know on Tuesdays and Thursdays it's like kind of a rough day but I between my first class and my second class there's straight up three hours
mhm
where I can just like Chill and do homework
Yeah
yeah like I like nine thirty was like earlier than I because I wanted to start at ten thirty
I'm starting at ten thirty every single day
I wish like Mondays I start at one thirty
Really
Yeah
I'd take like I'd take a nine thirty as opposed to a ten thirty if it meant I could sleep until one thirty on like Tuesdays or something
Yeah it's it's nice cause like Monday's I start late and then Fridays I end early and like it's hard like waking up at nine thirty but like it's m it's not like eight thirty like it's manageable still
Yeah if they're I I'm I made sure not to take any Friday classes and not to take any eight thirties
Yeah I wasn't gonna take a Friday class but like it just happened I like my Spanish class was on a Friday which is fine cause like it's just nine thirty to ten twenty so like after that I'm fine
and like
And then you're free for the day
Yeah like normally look on Fridays I would probably like wake up at ten thirty anyway so the fact that I'm done by ten twenty like it's it's so manageable
I mean I w I sleep till noon on Fridays I don't know about you but
I just I've already come back from Spanish and I get breakfast and then I go back to bed and then I wake up at like noon
That sounds perfect
Yeah it's amazing
Yeah I don't know I need to
I need to like probably better optimize my time just a little bit cause I'm not I'm definitely not getting the right amount of sleep right now
Yea
and I'm not like Doing the right amount of work
I I could be I just like don't like
like it it's just it's just
It's a lot there's a lot to think about
It's just me like procrastinating on my homework like this week I've been getting better at it like I've been like doing my work early but I save my work for like the day before it's due and it's just like
Yeah
I've bene just like not good at like
I'm
I'm trying to get better at like getting ahead of stuff
Oh my god
wait my bracelet
Did you lose it
Wait w
I'm like wait I'm not wearing it
Did you take it off out there
No
wait so you're check your wrist
Maybe maybe like it fell off when I was sleeping
Hopefully yeah
sorry is this really loud I like can't tell
No it that doesn't
Okay
It's a lot of Europe
Like normal amount I guess
but
so how you doing
Good
yeah
this is odd
It is it is it's a little uncomfortable but
yeah
I mean interest I guess
I know yeah the glass screens an interesting touch
I know I didn't I thought it was one of those double sided like
I know yeah it seems like a mirror something on one end
Yeah
Well so you t you a Tufts student

Data
Oh awesome
Yeah it's a lot of fun
yeah
it's been busy but good
I'm sure
Yeah
it's nice to have all the greek life back right
Yeah
Yeah I think so
yeah
yeah what bout you how are you liking freshman year
I like it a lot it's uh so I'm doing ROTC and lacrosse as well
oh okay cool
Um which has been a lot but um
Yeah
It's been a lot of fun
How does that work
um so ROTC like we have a three days sometimes four days a week and it just like really early in the morning on like Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Okay
Is it at Tufts or is it somewhere else
No so it's at B uh BU
Okay
and MIT so a lot of the Tufts people do MIT
oh
But I have to go to BU cause um I'm doing it for the marines
Okay
and it' s like a Smaller amount of people so we have more concentrated
Yeah
But it's been a it was definitely a rough transition at first but
That yeah must be so hard
yeah It wasn't wasn't very fun but kind of adjusting into it now which is nice
Okay that's good
yeah
what do you do it like during your training
Um variety of things so a lot of it's like kind of like classroom stuff
Okay
so like you'd if you just memorize bunch of stuff about like the military the professional knowledge
mhm
things like that and then it's more like then we do of course with the physical stuff which is just like we run around a bunch and do like calisthenics and stuff like that
Yeah
but Yeah that's that's pretty much it just the early like wake up and then of course we have to present ourselves in like a military way
right
with like the perfect uniform like
Yeah
Which gets to be really stressful
I know sometimes I see people like walking on campus with that
and I'm like where did you come from like where are youo
Yeah
like Are you
Yeah
What how old are you
yeah
um That's cool though
but yeah
Yeah I mean it's all about like the end result so
Yeah
that's really impressive I mean that's like Taking like two extra classes
I mean
before c
Well
worth it and  serve the country
Yeah
yeah
but yeah
nice
So you thinking of studying psychology
I'm a community health major
Really
Yeah and I also maybe wanna do biopsych
Really
so
that's awesome
We'll see how that goes yeah
Get all figured out I guess
Yeah I'm pre med so um I kind of have to
mhm
Okay that's fair
Yeah
That's fair
I know there was like oh you're freshman you have so much time to think about everything
yeah
No
and then you're like wait I can't graduate and you're like oh shoot
I feel that I I I'm way behind on shoes right now so I need to
oh yeah
I need a
I don't I don't like the shoe system
I don't I don't either what do you think about Canvas
It's so weird
brand new
uh I hate Canvas
Really
Yeah all I don't know it's fine truck was also fine
Yeah
I don't know I I just don't like the switching around
Yea
it messes me up
it's confusing
Yeah
But I I lucked out cause I had Canvas all through high school so to come in
Yeah
And have it again
No oh my gosh um I had Canvas in high school too
mhm
but that's why I didn't like it
really
cause we always had to it was like for my English class
Yeah
And we had to like read something and then write these responses and like post them on Canvas
and it was like such like a low key like assignment it was like for every reading we had to do one
mhm
mhm
but it stressed me out so much cause like you have to like respond to other people's and it has to be really Good and Yeah so anxiety can Canvas is associated with anxiety
I
don't understand that
no yeah
Yeah it's alright though
yeah no complaints
Yeah
I wonder what they're looking for in this is
I know I don't know and like I keep like looking at the camera
i know
because I think it's really large
it's freaking me out
and in the corner and like yeah
Yeah
hm
it's also like they posted online and like who watches that
yeah
I m m
just imagine like some
Hours and hours of like
some professor just [ ] like On a Sunday night like
Yeah random students like chatting okay
Exactly
I'm kind of curious I don't know
I know I wanna see what the results are like
Yeah right
know what I mean
Major said you have any crazy stories from freshman year
Um I don't know I don't know if I should tell you that in this setting
That's fair that's fair
um yeah I don't know it was a fun year it's good
Any advice
um oh god I don't know
the more wise
Yeah right I am just a so experienced in you know the world in whatever
oh yeah
I probably do I just can't think of it now
Sorry no pressure
yeah
I don't know do you know what you're majoring in
I don't know I I would hope psychology but I mean this I still have to take a bunch of classes to you know figure out exactly
mhm
Right
Yeah
cause I mean I right now I'm only taking I'm taking Spanish like English one
mhm
um that art history major course which I did not realize was an art history major course um and then intro to psych
nice
which I really like
but we'll see there could be other things as well
Yeah
but yeah
um I have one piece of advice if you think you like psychology
mhm
and you might want to major in it you should like take um the required classes that like might overlap with other fields that you'd be interested in as soon as possible
Okay
You know
alright yeah
like you don't have to like dive into all the like psych major requirements
Yeah
like if you're not sure but like there's a lot of things that overlap between similar things and you could start with those
That is good advice
Thank you thank you very much
but yeah no uh I don't any classes you recommend taking
I don't know um I'd like in like my favorite classes are ones that have like a lot of prerecs like for my major
Yep
and so it's really annoying because like You have to like be in the major to take it
Yep
Um I took genetics last semester
mhm
If you're at all like a science person that was a really cool class
Yeah
um it was hard though but it was cool
yeah
Yeah I don't know
I'd take that
now you my uh my father and grandfather were both doctors so
oh cool
Kind of always been involved in like the sciences
Yeah
the [] sciences either well whether I want to or not
Yeah
but uh no definitely
yeah
I think uh
yeah I don't know I don't know
Yeah I have I like was thinking so I want to go abroad next semester
Yep
so like I'll just get like all of my requirements out of the way this year like totally easy right
Psychotic
like no problem
I know yeah so I'm like in chem and physics right now
for pre med and I'm just dead
mhm
yeah I'm sure
all the time
it sucks
Where you want to go abroad
To Italy
Hello
probably
Yeah
Okay
I started taking Italian here and I like think it's really cool
really
so
a Any place in Italy
Yeah
like
They have this one program through brown um it's like Brown in and blow or something
mhm
and it seems really cool
That's awesome
Yeah I I have no idea though I have time to think about
So itd be just like a semester or would you try to go a year
No probably just the semester yeah
At first I was thinking about a year but that;s such a long time to be away from tufts
oh yeah
And like all your friends
And like home
and yeah it's like it's crazy
There will be quite an experience I mean come back absolutely fluent in Italy Italian
Yeah
Can you go abroad
yeah
No I mean so there is certain but I could theoretically through ROTC and then through the school
but on top of like lacrosse as well like I can't
Okay
Because we're
are you on the lacrosse team
yes
wow you're busy Jeez okay
I think I think I piled my plate a little little too high
Yeah
maybe
but uh yeah no so for that I'm not I'm noto allowed to and also I'd have to get like what just security clearances and stuff like
oh interesting
Which is just a pile of paperwork don't want to go through
That's wild okay yeah jeez
no
um wait do you know what like macs walt something
Waltbomb
Yeah
Yeah
he's in my Italian class
really
Yeah
all most of the sophomores in the team are actually in Lewis too they're no the third floor
Yeah
yeah
it's crazy
I know there's another kid there's like two other kids in my Italian class um also on the lacrosse team
mhm
and they always like sit together and I don't know their names
mm okay
but yeah I know they're on the team
Max is Max is way more out going
Yeah he's so funny he's been in my class for like the last three semesters and he's just very entertaining
that's awesome
yeah
fun stuff
oh yeah
do
They always like come with it's not a water bottle like a whole water jug
I know
and I'm like
it's crazy
Okay thirsty much
I know serioulsy if I drank that I'd probably throw up all over the place
I know
thing's giant
Yeah
yeah
What are there uh do you do any other clubs on campus like
um I'm in green dot
Okay
know what that is
yes
yeah
I just started that this year so that's pretty cool
yeah
um and then I was like I helped out at a the blood drive a little bit I had this whole plan that I was gonna do all the stuff this year
Yeah
and then I was just like this is too much I can't do it
of course
so um
yeah
Yeah have to figure that out
You try to get involved in TEMS
Yeah I know my friend just got on it
um yeah it seems like really intense or it is really intense
really
yeah
um but fun
Yeah
Cool
My F ways in that right now
and That's all she talks about she loves
Yeah
Really
Loves it so much
All
yeah
oh also wait who's the okay Alex um I don't know his last name that phrase for Tilton
Yes
Alex and then also Zach Gould
mhm
they were all on my floor last year yeah
really
yeah it was so funny like when they were like applying to be FYAs last year
Yeah
and the like gotten Tilton really aw you're not leaving like
it was really funny
yeah another for Alex I don't think he likes us very much
I think he comes across that way like with everyone
Yeah
yeah But Zach's all fun love and like wants to know everybody
He's so nice
yeah
yeah
he's a really nice guy
yeah And then Hannah's the the TEMS FYI she apparently was in there
oh yeah I think I know I wonder if she there's a Hannah FYEd for me last year to I wonder if it's the same one
Probably I think so I think this was her third third like second or third year doing it
Right yeah
Yeah
I just thought they like switched you between dorms
Yeah
but like maybe not
She's like the head of like the Busch Tilton complex
hm
I guess
Oh okay that makes sense then
yeah
cool Okay
I'm she's definitely an underachiever
yeah
um Do you know like what you're gonna do next year for housing this is so in advance but like
oh yeah I'm not s I have an opportunity to live in one of the lacrosse houses
oh cool
but I don't know if that'd be a great idea
Yeah I don't know
Yeah um if not we'll probably wind up either going to like Louis or try to go to like Haskell or something
Yeah
uh
it Depends on the lottery
we'll see
I know oh my gosh housing is terrible at tufts
I'm sure
like warning [ ] it's like the worst thing that happens at the school
yeah
it's Incredibly stressful yeah
Yeah it sucks
Do you live in a single or are you ua double
No I'm in a double
oh that's nice
Yeah I was with my same roommate from last year
Really
which is cool yeah
that is awesome
Yeah
ah I lucked out we had a well we had the random housing
Yeah
And uh my roommate wound up being an awesome guy like
That's awesome
such like so down to earth so nice like guy
That's so nice yeah
yeah
that's good
I know I did firm I mean I did random to
Yeah
And yeah I love my roommate she's like one of my closest friends and like Really living together this you're living in a house next year so
really
that's good
Where do you  [] live next year
yeah
um I'm on third street
Okay yeah
Do you know yeah like right to Davis
yes
Yeah
That's awesome
I'm like at the second house um it's the one with the like porch and then on the one right next to it
Yeah
really
Yeah
that's cool
It's exciting
what's that like the the building it I think it's like a church or something but like the Kind of a decorative like front it it's like very so you have all these all these like normal houses on like a row and then you have this one which is just lik a big it looks like a church but it's like a like a face on the outside
hm
Is it like passed on um the circle
yeah
you know
it's past that circle
Yeah yeah yeah
yeah
I don't know what that is
It's a it's kind of weird I don't know yeah
It is I always see people coming in and out and I'm like wait what are you doing in there
oh really I feel like I've never seen anyone around there ever
really
yeah and it was like what is an abandoned place like I don't know
yeah
I don't know
oh
the questions this is an interesting Interesting area for sure
I know
Yeah I think you music school or something
Yes
but I have no idea
yeah like a pre Preschool
How cool okay huh
man
Davis is nice though it I mean do you live like in the city in Boston
yeah
No I live in a suburb
Okay
Yeah
alright so this is kind of similar to
Yeah a little bit
yeah
I know I'll actually live in Winchester
Okay yeah yeah yeah
do you know
yeah super close
oh yeah
Yeah
But uh no I have do you know a kid named Walker have by any chance
mm mm
no
alright well I went to school and wound up getting kicked out and he went to Winchester
Really
which was his home town yeah
oh my god
For like a year Winchester high school
That's so funny
Did you go to Winchester high school
No I didn't
okay
that's why um
some of my friend did he might know
okay
yeah
I know I like live in Winchester but I like didn't go to school there so I'd like a fake resident and like it's so funny because like my friend they close friend of mine in colleges from Winchester
No
mhm
and then we were like how people can look so familiar but like what we there's no way we would know eac h other
yeah
like so weird and so we must have just like seem to the like a round town like
Probably yeah
And high school or something like I I didn't know him at all but yeah we hung out of the summer and he's like showing the other like the places w here the Winchester kids like would go
and I was like wow I did not know this but look at like how cool
mhm
oh yeah
Did you have like friends and stuff that were in Winchester
I went to um like a private school so it was like mostly just like scattered around and like all kinds of different towns
mhm
Yeah
Um so like they're friends of mine lived like in like Lexington and Arlington
mhm
and stuff but not really Winchester not too many
oh
yeah
I feel like most of the people in Winchester wind up going to to private schools or like scattered around
Yeah
because I most of the people that like I've interacted with I went to a boarding school and most people that I interacted with there were like from Winchester
really
mainly from like day students
oh weird
yeah that was strange but uh it was it was definitely kind of cool to think of the different towns in the way that work
Yeah
In that way
Where did you go to school
uh I went to Phillips Andover
Oh oh my god no way okay yeah that's a really good school
It
Um
it was alright
it was hard
Yeah
It was a lot
Yeah yeah
very hard
that's what I've heard
but yeah prepares you well for this for Tufts though
What
oh yeah I bet do you know on the Welsh twins
prepa
Yes
yeah
yeah I know them very well
Yeah they um like went to my school for like a year
or like um Charlotte did
really
Okay
and Casey too the older one
What school
Um no noon country day
sorry yeah
Okay yeah yeah
um yeah and I we used to carpool
oh really
mhm
yeah I know they're awesome I love them all it's just
Yeah they're so nice
So much fum
Yeah
They're incredibly talented it's so good at sports too
Oh my god I know I think Shawn's at at like Yale
Yes to that yeah

yeah Elizabeth's at Williams and then Casey's at BU
she's doing ROTC too
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
but yeah no they're
It's so crazy
they're just like the most fun loving people like I've ever met [ ]
They're so nice
yeah
oh yeah
Yeah their whole family is really great
mm
Definitely
Yeah it's funny I you like when I was really little I used to play on the Winchester soccer team
mhm
and like the Welsh twins like weren't like on a team
mhm
they were just like brought in when one team was like doing really bad badly
Actuall
yeah they were like so good they would like come for one game like score ten goals and then leave again and we were like who are these people like it's crazy
that's awesome
I know it was was really funny they were like famous
and then trying to think Zack Geddes
oh yeah I do actually know him yeah
he's awesome I like him a lot
Yeah
The eyebrows
I know yeah he's friends with um Like one of my best friends from high school I think not like at school
mhm
yeah
That's funny
yeah he seems to be liking it a lot
Yeah
G town
Yeah
yeah
Do you
I was uh opening to go visit soon um like my friend there
oh yeah
but I don't know like when is a good time so
Who knows when that'll happen
that's the thing
I but the break schedule is kind of strange like I feel like we like we don't have any time for like the this like thanksgiving we only have a couple days right
yeah
Yeah
mhm yeah
and then for the winter break like we're kind of on the same schedule as everybody else so we'll be seeing everyone else where
Yeah I know yeah
But no complaints from me
It's kind of weird
Yeah it's also like everyone's so busy during the semester
that you always have these like plans to like Go visit other schools and stuff and then you're like I have no time
Yeah
and I'm tired
mm
and like Whatever yeah
yeah
What happened to your hand
oh um I I do it like self defense um krav maga
oh really
yeah
awesome
And so I I like s bit my knuckle and it was like fine but then I [] like scratched it on something else
mhm
and then it started bleeding alot so I was like okay I guess have to put a bandaid on
where do you do the Krav Maga
Um I actually did it like in high school
mhm
at a place in Medford
really
you know like Rashankish um I don't know if you Like wouldn't know it it unless you know it
Rasheik
like na I don't know
It's like yeah I know um
Whe where is it
It's like if you walk by like five seventy four
mhm
um and then like into like like two streets over there's like the main street of Medford I guess
Yeah
um really one of them and it's on that street
awesome
Yeah I know I yeah I did it in high school and really liked it and then I came to tufts and I was like oh could like keep going
mhm
obviously it's so close but I took a break to see if like I don't know there's anything on campus I wanted to do
Yeah
Um but like one of the instructors from there teaches like a self defense class like through tufts
mhm
um and like one of my friends is in it so I just go with her
that's awesome
Yeah it's really fun
yeah
yeah my uh my little brother does it as well and he absolutely loves it
Uhm really
he tries to show us like all the moves
yeah
and then like it
Yeah
like ask my my other brothers or myself or my dad or something to attack and he's like I can defend myself
yeah
Yeah
Not yet no you're in the Foundational stages
Okay
Yeah
yeah
yeah It's just really fun
Yeah
definitely a good thing to knos
Yeah how many siblings do you have
Three younger brothers
oh wow nice
yeah
do you have any siblings
I have an older sister
oh really
mhm
how much older
Two years
oh awesome
Yeah
you close with her
Yeah she goes to harvard actually so we see each other a lot
Really
oh that's awesome
yeah
Which is pretty cool yeah
yeah
I know neither of us like went at all far
I know it's like m
yeah
It s there's something to be said about staying pretty close
right
Yeah honestly like if people are always like do you go home like every day and I'm like no
it's a home away from home
but I can get to home when I want to
Yeah
exactly it's so convenient
Exactly
mhm
you ever go home and like the weekends at all like to go just Relax
Sometimes I get
Yeah sometimes um like I'll go home to study
mhm
like I went home during finals and I was like really helpful cause like it just like locked myself in a room and like not contact with anyone
oh yeah
um which is good and yeah sometimes I'll just go home for like dinner or something I went home cooked meal
yeah
which is nice
that is that is nice
yeah
Dewick is nice but it gets old after awhile
I know yeah I like feel bad complaining about it cause it's actually like one of the nicer dining halls
oh yeah
like at schools um but it's just like gets old after a while
Yeah I mean like they they do an amazing job like
Right
With food but like I feel like just like the atmosphere like
Yeah
mm coming there every single day is like ugh
no
again
Definitely
yeah
Hodgins a nice change of pace though
Yeah I like it
I'm still trying to figure out like all the best places to eat
I know yeah you have to have like your special at each and each place
oh yeah
I've been I've been absolutely wasting money at the tower though getting sushi
oh really
yeah
I've have never had sushi there
It's pretty good
Okay
Well it's like market basket sushi
but like
okay
Interesting
Tides you over
yeah
yeah
it's good study s study snack
Yeah
oh yeah have you found a good study place on campus
uh Kind of I mean when I really have like a lot of work to do I just kinda buckle down in my room but uh
Okay
Go to the library sometimes and then I love the top of the library and like when it's really nice
mm
It's so nice
yeah just like bundle up and start reading on the top or something like that
Yeah
but
Other than that not really
Yeah I feel like I never really took advantage of like Tisch roof when it was warm enough
mhm
to like actually sit out there but it's so nice
It is absolutely beautiful and like it's not doesn't have to always be like the sunset sunrise
Right
like just looking out at the skyline is so cool
it's just nice yeah
That's true
ch
feel like you're on top of the world top of the hill
Yeah
oh I feel like you're like want water or something
I know
god all this talking
But it did say some light refreshments were gonna be Included
True right where are they
I don't know
maybe that would like interfere with our like body language or something
yeah
that could
yeah
Yeah
I wonder if like we're gonna be compared like to other other groups [] as well
I yeah I don't know
be like oh like this person and like Horrible body language
weird
Yeah right like oh they clearly hate each other like okay
I don't know I like once read this cool thing about how like you know how there's like people that are like really charismatic
Yep
and like get along with other people really well
They're like like one of the reasons I guess that they can do that is cause they like match their like for voice frequency like well to others
really
like it I guess yeah when you like are talking to someone you like match their like speaking pattern in a way
mhm
and like people that are like connect really well with others like can like match it better or something
hm
it seemed really cool yeah
that's interesting
I know right
yeah I I should do kind of wonder like what makes people like good with people skills
Yeah
and stuff like that
it's like it's weird yeah
yeah
hm
cause you think everyone's kind of like pretty basically like standard
but then there's some people who are just like so good at like s connecting with people
Yeah
and like what is it
Yep
you know
Sometimes I feel like it's just like excessive like like energy
Yeah
yeah true
what you mean it like that definitely rubs off on people
it's like
Yeah
That's fair
You love having that person that just makes your day
Yeah yeah definitely
but Yeah I mean those that was really cool thing like just sitting back and watching during orientation
mhm
like how everybody interacted
Yeah
And it's like you see the people who are like trying incredibly hard to like to make connections and then there's the people that the subtle connections like
mhm
that don't that aren't so overt about their about their intentions and stuff like that
Yeah I know did you know anyone coming to tufts
I knew actually a fair amount of people
Okay
um
Just like basically from like high school and and uh you know people around
Yeah
in the surrounding areas that wound up going to Tufts
mhm
I don't know It's like they're all trying to help me you know
Yeah
Transition
That's nice
And then they're a bunch of kids uh
Of course I knew the lacrosse team like coming in
Right
And then I'd do a couple kids that I graduated with and u h yeah it was nice having like familiar faces
so wasn't like absolute reset but
mhm
Yeah exactly I yeah I guess also being part of a team that like makes a huge difference
cause They have like a group of people
Yeah
no definitely
There
but then we like I don't know I just feel like kind of
I like pressured to lik kinda pressured to like be part of that like team image
Right yeah
I don't know I didn't really want that coming out of the gate kinda wanted just do my own things
Yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
The athlete section at Dewick
He is like fifteen tables pushed together
I know
like okay
they just had the new additions to Dewick
Yes
What do you think about them
I hate them
Thank you
they're terrible
thank you
Yeah no especially because they like are replacing tables
Yep
But instead of just like actually swapping them out they just take tables away
and then there are no tables and I'm Dewick is already not big enough
yeah I know
yeah
for everyone
exactly
It's really bad
And then you have the the giant like the the size differential
Yeah it's so weird
And the colors the colors I don't
uh I know
The green doesn't go
I don't like it and like the square tables I feel like just fit less people
no yeah
It's really weird
Well you gonna sit on a corner
yeah I don't know it's also like a this was so awkward like so I can usually have breakfast like alone cause I just have class pretty early
Yeah
Um at the circular tables like if everything's taken you can just like sit with someone at a circular table and its like totally fine
yeah
but then I was like sitting at one of the like like rectangular ones and it was like a stranger and then me and then another stranger and it was like as if we were like eating together but like awkwardly silent and like it was just so uncomfortable cause we were so close and I was like I don't like this
Please give me back my big tables
uh that stuff then you just feel kind of obligated to to have a conversation
Yeah and like you can't make eye contact
like so
and you're like oh sorry sorry
yeah
It was it is not fun
Dewick's kind of a cool place to study too though
Yeah
I mean not like seriously study but like
Yeah yeah you have to do like like the fake homework
Yeah
Yeah  just make yourself feel like you're being productive
Yeah
What's up
we have nothing to talk about
Um
yeah
I'm sleepy

But the jacket you were wearing yesterday didn't you get wet through that because it seemed like it was just absorbing the water
The jacket was bad but I didn't get wet with this stick

It's prettycool actually
like
is it just a
it's just a glass yeah it's a glass
it's a glass it's not a mirror it's not like you can see yourself
Yeah but no the rooms' identical on both sides so I got confused
probably just the layout
n yeah
cool
yeah
hm
What
What's the purpose of putting us in two different rooms
Umm through phone I'm not have a normal conversation with a microphone
okay
and then you did the study probably
hm
n yeah
But it was actually completely identical even the paintings are identical it looks like this is a mirror but it's not
Mm yeah
yeah
Common arctic architect design model
room like this
or a more fancy version of it
why
I don't know
or maybe you can have your room which is identical on both sides
but why would I want that
This s make it creepy
it's
that so weird
Mhm
I would not want that
divide it into half and put a mirror in the middle
that was
Make my room into two rooms that makes my big room into two small rooms four rooms defeats the purpose of having a big room
Quite miss my room actually
My parents finally moved out of it
Mm
finally after three months of living months of my leaving
My running is a my brothers if those
mm yeah but I hate it any time anyone goes to college from my house it turn whoe that person's room into a guest room
well that doesn't happen
no and no but like tch
like for my room it can't happen when my brother stays there a f elder brother's room happened
oh n̲
you c̲a̲n't sleep there like if my um like chacha Chachi̲ t̲
in t̲heir house so l̲ike that it's not l
mm

All of
Nearly your legs um

upper body
I don't really know I haven't done anything on the walk of side like I came here
No but I don't think what is wrong we didn't do upper body like couldn't I
But it little stretching
Certainly stretching doesn't make you very hurt
it could
no stretching's just like makes it hurt hurt less the next day
Oh so shouldn't you stretch before exercising
mm she kinda do like both
cause
but like I don't do like I don't know mainly cardio so I don't stretch before I do cardio
Mhm
and then after I just do abs and then for abs I don't really need to stretch before
How do you know all these like be ninety two
Okay our if you I used to play basketball so I don't know
Mm
Yeah like I used to do a lot of different stuff when I used to play but like
Not me not I wouldn't do any abs I used to do like
In school I used to get tired in the warmup only of the sport and then I used to not play the sport
No so I used to love playing sports in school so whenever I had a free period or like when I don't like you know I was just chilling I used to love whoever was playing I would go play with them
that unless they were kids
Oh
Like if there was anyone so to my age group was playing I used to go play with them
oh
or sometimes I'd just do like a friend or do we would to play with it
Like it was just like my mental relaxation my like you know make me feel good
Mm
Who were your bask who were your basketball friends
like
I don't think you know any of their names
it's like
Oh so the people who you talk about are not from your basketball team
Like my friends group my friend group center from a basketball game were like
Mhm
um I'm really close to my basketball team like are there was part of the basketball team
Mhm yeah
okay okay
But like by the end of it she didn't usually play
Hm
like she was just there for my moral support
But by the end of it do you also didn't play
But
No I played but I just played less seriously
okay
yeah that I had to play because I was
like yeah no it's all who's like an obligatinoo
Mhm
but
but like no I love playing bridges but I didn't have time and I just took it less seriously like I still play it but
Mm
Who is just not as that it's just not like before and plus I couldn't I would leave because I love my team too much
Yeah
Like if you ask me who I don't like right now I talked to like a to the jaw
Do you need it but like the most of my team
I'm not gonna remember these
But like well idea are those old so like when they'er together then I talk to them
Mhm
sometimes
No
I like when I go back from where we live all of them they a little
Yeah I talk to Alice
I'm not talked like some of my seniors who were like on the team before
mm yeah
but like not on a regular basis but I talk to them
Mm
and stuff touch with them
I know what close to any of my seniors in both my schools
No so in my in my school I was close to like
Of like I was close to a few
The batch above me I was close to like two three two batches above me
And then like even when I was a classics I was close to like my captains I'm still in touch with them
And actually I sort of basically now my class six captains of about six email as
Mm
I'm my elder brothers friends some of them
oh
So like I still see them and like you know it's the two of them
Okay yeah
we like to lobe my brothers friends sometimes so
You chill with your brothers friends when you were in class six and they were in class twelve
No no no I didn't chill with them at that point I chill with them now
Okay okay
Like for the last two years one or two years
yeah
I that's why I was like clearly small but like also he was in boarding school at that point and he was not here and her was not at home and plus he was in college
Hm
so that used the hardly shopping but even as a kid I used to sit with them so like that was his brother's friends like my brother's friend
Yeah
they used to play risk
What
They used to play a game called risk
what is that
and like
the lot of soldiers
I knew is Nicole conquer territories so like you just like so basically what they used to do it like one of them used to cheat
Mm
so he used to just stuck his soldiers randomly and then you know the like we're gonna misplaced access so that had on the side so ice who them windows cheating and it's gonna be so much fun cause I knew that he was going to cheat
so i used tto sit with him even that time but like I didn't get what they were saying or what they were doing because I was really small
Cute
Because he's like six years older than me so
wait how come your brother went to boarding school is that a thing in your family for like the boys to go to boarding school
No
cause it's like that in like many many families I know
No no so like my brother went to a boarding school because he was an  before
and
what is that
it's my nanny's school
Oh
So my mom tell you a special attention and she didn't want that because like you know so nice
Mm
so that's why
I feel that
So that's way like she that that's why he went to boarding school no so wouldn't do IB because he didn't like though CBSE board
Mm
so that's why he went in nine
I don't think anybody likes to CVS people this is do it
Yeah like he found them more difficult than the IB
he found CBS more difficult
Because
not more difficult residing much better than IB because he thinks logically in CVS you need to more up
yeah true happens
So like he did much better in the IB and my younger brother's probably not going to boarding school because he's too spoiled
Same
and also like he's proobably not going because he them entertaining and out of my desktop and so on this and him also
Yeah when my younger brother so was spoiled you have no idea he's not been to school twelve days right now cause a slight fever my parents used to send me to school with hundred and two fever also
yeah no I used to decide whether I wanted to go to school or not
Yeah but like I used to decide to go to school with fever also because like you know the for the played with my brother locked pisses me off so much
No I I never went to school I used to find excuses not to go to school but no like It depended like
I used to love school
most of like the class Dan I guess it was good regularly eleven because like it's a waste of time have so much work I'd rather stay and do the work
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
So like eleven today so months with it but but not too much
Even I mountain twelve
But not too much because I should are our had woken school as one would like with the different activities
that there was always something going on so when there was something going on we couldn't long and I could only bank when like can nice sometimes walk I no longer than the deal for this is what the day before
Hm
oh we weren't allowed to bunk the day before a test
Or even we weren't allowed but like like you know I actually used to fall asleep because so much pressure
actually used to fall asleep with the pressure
Oh
and I used to fall and I wouldn't go to school or sometimes nice isn't just a bout so we weren't allowed to bunk the week before exams so I used to so walk bank
The whole week
Yup s like before like finals of awful if you weren't allowedto bunk the previous week
yeah same
I thought this is ridiculous school and just my school
No so then so then after so what I used to do is bunk of toys the entirety of the previous week
Yeah before the are free
But Even if we weren't allowed like you know and what happened was I was slightly sicken is school during that week
Further
Hm
and there were teachers you are you six them one two three to after that also
Yeah
When I lived I used to go to the north on Monday the week before finals
and I used to say like I have a really bad stomach ache and stuff she used to send me home and they swung the rest of the week so then my teachers couldn't see
Okay we didn't have a nurse
you didn't have a medical team in school
we had this one teacher who was really sweet so she used to help
That's retarded
where like
Yeah but like they would never gives as any medicines because they were not a doctor going is hang and then the usually you could just go and sleep which looks like you're usually that in there to do it but I use usually used to get my way and do it
how can you not have
but What if someone like faints and stuff in school or what gets really sick then
No different
You should have a nurse isn't that like a requirement in all schools in India
no
It is for sure
We don't have a nurse to the Jewish ahead of like a could kind of just sit at a lab assistant she used to have
Oh my god
why a lab assistant
My old school used to have like four doctors not nurses
what
That's
F O
That's crazy oh my god yeah
Who is figure that happened
Mm
wow you should have a nurse in school
Can be dangerous
Yeah
but my school was literally right opposite hospital
like across the road
but it was an eye hospital but it's still a hospital
what do y̲ou e̲ye hosp
a hospital for like e̲ye stuff
oo eye I I thought it was I I hospital
I
The letter I hospitals I was like what are you saying
Oh I like I house like that I know I know what's going in India hey
yeah
no
oh my god
oh my god I have so much calculus I just remembered
All the quizzes and homeworks are due on Monday
What
Calculus
what's that I don't know what that is
yeah no okay I'm gonna do that after my nap today
very the nap
Yeah right after breakfast and basically
I'm very sleepy
yeah I kinda don't want to go back to my room and then go to the gym but I don't have my clothes and probably have probably have to do that
yeah no to will sit with me while eat breakfast so you have to
Convenient
Yeah convenient for you to go walk to your dorm
convenient for you that I'm going back to my dorm
if you put it that way
Mm
what else
what was that
I could hear myself
What's the time
what's the time
No idea
mm
wait so your aunt's she has like
how how many children does she have
Oh
Why does she have so many rooms in her house then
she has two sons who have children
Yeah but when
her sons were were going up and stuff then like it wouldn't make sense to have like a five bedroom house for four people
not five bedroom
There were like three upstairs
There two ups
there are three upstairs
Oh I didn't see the third one
Mm
She stays downstairs
I'm sure must be another one that we didn't see cause there's a basement also
oh I don't know I have no idea
yeah
Surprising
yeah I feel bad that I left the food though
Hm
I thought she was coming to the garden to say bye I feel really bad about not saying bye she was so nice to me
I think she was feeling sick
yeah like I think she was going to but then I was leaving
yeah
But also the route uh that it was showing today was different than the one last night so I think the one today's the one she was talking about
Oh man
cause uh last night it was showing from her house to Boston to tufts
I don't think so
but this was showing from her house straight to Tufts it wasn't crossing Boston
Mhm
I don't know
I have no idea
yeah I check
Yeah
hm
You can check the go bus
mm yeah
if you want to like
but I can't change it now already done
mm that's fine it's not that bad
Yeah
um also go bus has so many stops and the car doesn't have any stops
that has one stop
Go bus no it has like two three three stops
Yeah
Go bus
No she said she has one stop
Yeah
No she said it has two three stops
No no she said it only like basically
Oh no
It's Dawson criminal he stops in Newton
Yeah I no no I looked it up yesterday it stops in two places at least
I don't know
Yeah it does I looked it up from New York to Boston sorry Boston to New York I saw it while I was in the
Mm
so it has more stops and that's kinda annoying and maybe like she's saying megabus is not nice because it's double decker so if you go to like go sit on the top deck that goes something that's still nice but
I will sit on the top deck it's not bad at all
yeah so I'm just you know what was better though what what all
[inaudible]
I don't know it's same what it matter
I don't know
Were you sitting with someone
I mean there was a girl but like I was a alone of one for like six hours
Hm
I can hear you breathing
what about the cough
stop
If you like your mucus s getting to me too
Oh yeah I hope
It feels like this this window like looks like a mirror
Yeah
Except it's just like not me on the other side
Can you hear my wrinklin'
what
laughs
Wrinkling of the hair
Actually no I couldn't
Really 'cause it's kind of echoy in here I like it it's kinda homey like vibe over here
Should we ask if they're renting for next year
um how much is it per month we just set up a table
oh this cute plant
Yeah
This bugs me out it's like exact reflections
They they absolutely did that on purpose
Oh yeah
We're too tired for this we're just gonna laugh
Good morning America welcome to I feel like I'm on a podcast right now

How's your water
li
I haven't drink a yet it's kind of hard with this microrphone in the way
You can do it
I can't okay they said this was bendy but I can't bend
I feel like mine's in a much wronger position than yours
mm wronger
Can you hear me breathing though
no

I'm sorry I'm congested
I'm also congested
I realized that I forgot to get a sub for work tomorrow
oh god why haven't you been fired
I don't know they love me too much

wow look at you
maybe they can't afford to lose me I'm
I feel like I need to ice my face is it still swollen
Yeah but mine is too
Hey
stop
oh my God goodness gracious
oh god I really hope I don't just start coughing and then not be able to stop coughing
contagious cough
How do they clean these microphones
oo that's a good question
They probably have some spray and it's probably just like very concentrated
I just feel bad cause if we're coughing all up on this
antibacterial
You you just coughed on it directly when I said that
Oh yeah
Oh my god
hh ah I̲ can't do this
Yes y̲ou absolutely can
I mean
Oh
I thought you just meant like t̲alk for like thirty minutes and I was like yes you can
that was like a close call
we can do this
That was a close call
did your alarm go off
mhm
I think I heard your alarm go off
I think so our alarm system is very
weird
my live's just a
your alarm's a your alarm system is whack
mhm
It's like So funny
it's just
I'm just like so asleep that I won't wake up
You're a very Very deep sleeper
till one
to One so I gotta put on at least three
And they're not e like
They're all like the worst possible alarm sounds
and I still don't get up
that's insane
Oh my god
What is
At least it's not like Do you remember last year
Happeninin
When like you're like beeping one would go off
And then I would go to the bathroom
and then it would keep beep and I would have to get up but like I didn't know how to turn it off
you just like threw the alarm clock at the door
I was like kept pressing buttons and then eventually it would stop but then sometimes I also hit snooze so then I would get back in bed and then it'd go off again honestly I normally just unplugged it
And then I wouldn't notice and that's why I probably wouldn't get up the next day we'll just leave it at that
that's so full that hard even if you unplug it
it's weird
Really
mhm
For like a couple hours and then it goes away
That's so weird
mhm
how do they do that
mm
it's very first
plus my times wrong it's like two minutes
Fixe it
behind
I'm too lazy
mhm
I know I always think that's it's like good for me to be behind but It's better to be ahead
Yeah then it just makes you late to everything
it really does
I should put it two minutes ahead
I heard that
Or you can set it to the real time
That's just a thought though
What good would that do
I don't know then you would know what time it is
Can you see under this cause I wore those with the
Under where
oh my god I can't
you can't
wait we both had our feet up at the thing
aw
cause it's comfy
I'm pretty comfy
I feel like I'm on a mirror
oh my god
it's sayonara
this feels like those like bonding exercises
ee uu ee uu
oh my god
when are your parents coming
mm like twelve thirty I think they said they were like oh like what time should we come and then
I said like I'd be free after twelve and then they were like okay we're probably gonna le oh wait just kidding hold on
I like turn sideways when like okay
It's not gonna leave me
I think they're coming earlier which I did not think about
Can we still get coffee
they might come at like
They might come at like twelve
what
we're still getting coffee
okay if you want
Yeah
You want
probably
Should I
at twelve
uh should I go to like the dining hall and eat or something
Now
I have like a Hodge egg sandwich in our fridge right now
really
yeah cuz Carino went to Hodge yesterday but I couldn't go cause I had a meeting
mhm
but
Now it's in our fridge and I don't know how good it i will be
like heating it up in the Microwave
when
When
yesterday
when did you yesterday
If we could work our toaster it'd be good in the toaster
oh Yeah it's pobably gonna burn right now
Did you know that the microwave isn't like from the
School
really
Emma brought it
really
yeah
wow what would our lives be without that microwave
sad
Very and that toaster like is that from the school
or did someone bring it
I don't know I don't know but nobody knows how to use it so
there's no directions either so
Also like the microwave you know how like Reina accidentally like
Exploded Something in there
No no no that was like the worst hand motion for
She like shattered
The the like plate at the bottom of the microwave
she did
dude my eyes burn so bad um
Yeah like accidentally but she like shattered it
That's gross
And
and like didn't tell Emma
Is that where it shoot or
I feel like
someone was like where's the glass plate
Yeah I feel like Reina didn't know it was Emma's either
mm mm
I really thought it came with the school
Wow thank god for that microwave cause otherwise I could not have my
Dyno nuggets
mhm
I honestly really love the waffle maker little mini egg
Good for egg
Also
Really excited to see this house today
Oh shit you're goin' on a house tour
The one on Whitfield
What which one is that
Come at three fifteen
Which one is dude I don't think I can
I'm gonna drag both of my parents
Is that the
it's on wif it's
Like right
Next to Lewis like if you go across the bridge and keep going it's like on that street
what bridge are you talking about
There's like Hodge and there's like a Lewis bridges it's just like a random walkway it's like a bridge
There's just like nothing underneath definition of a bridge
You mean like the you just mean Lewis right
Yeah
okay word
I need to sneeze
Don't do it don't do it
It's gonna hurt if I keep it in
You can do it
But that's a good location
that is a good locat is that the four person one
mhm
and I don't think nine hundred's too bad but that's six person one with the pool
okay I don't know if that's gonna happen or not though he was like they have an open house for that today
ew it feels like you're coughing into my ear
hey
But they have an open house for it today but like I asked if he was like sure that it was available for like the time we need it
mhm
And he was like I'm somewhat sure like I'll let you know as soon as I find out
and like I'm not trying to go to the open house
mm mm
and also like if it is not as cheap as I think it is
How would it not be
It might not be I don't know dude it has a pool which is super unnecessary
but also doesn't raise the hi price of the house
I feel like it would
Right
I feel it would be more expensive
mhm
maybe we're not allowed to use it
No it says
pool for those hot summer days so I feel like it's not just to like be there
that's fair
I don't know I want him to hit me back and be like it's available and it's this cheap
It's not a lie and it's close to Davis or closer in that direction
It's in it's more like if you just from the bottom of Tufts went sideways
mm
Does that make any sense
it's like I'm picturing near the round about now
Yeah it's like if from the round about you went like
Away from tufts but not downwards towards Davis like to the right
like towards the pub
I don't know dude
mm
it's on Harvard street
fuck Harvard
Okay it's not at like Harvard University
Obviously but that was my first reaction
oh my god
mm
Sorry for that curse word
oh my God
Give me ideas of things to do today
For Halloween
with my p no not for Halloween I meant with my parents
Priorities
We even have the same picture
I'm guessing it's for like
Okay I thought it was like
Continuity perspective
Yeah its definitely like for like controls
but like
oh yeah
it's kinda sus because it makes us look like a mirror cause I think this window like looks weird
Maybe it's just cause it's really like clean
Maybe they could make it a like one right mirror or a two way mirror like they could have different effects on it it's high tech
Hi tech
this is where our money's going
Into this mirror okay today you could go
Go down to the north end
go around Little Italy then to the seaport
It's nice down there and if it's as nice as it says it's gonna be
Which
That's like sixty five and partly sunny
hell yeah
hell yeah

Right
I think it's doc brown
unless that's a different doctor
did I show you how Jack asked me to prom one year
doctor
using that
Yeah
So funny
I remember oh my god
that was like I first watched that movie like a week before
Just when full in on it
He was like you should probably watch back to the future and I was like
wow he was really set on doing it
Why
I feel like that's something you do if like
he's so
your date is like super into back to the future
Yeah
Not if you have to like get her to watch it before
Oh I think that was like the theme I'm pretty sure
Oh really
of prom mhm
damn ours didn't have a thing
Really
Never
no
it was our after prom do you have after prom
like not through the school
mm
but like people have their own after prom from I feel significantly more like congested than but I did
y Yesterday
That's not joyful
I think I'm getting better so
I hope so it's horrible it's a horrible life to live
being congested
You haven't gotten your flu shot yet right
no I'm scared to get it when I'm like sick
Yeah I don't wanna get it when I'm sick either
Plus I don't know if CVS has started their little thing
I think they have
But do they give you a coupon
a coupon
last year they like gave you gave you like a five off twenty five coupon or something
When you got your flu shot
I mean I never got my flu shot last year you remember that struggle
That's true
But I saw the signs up for it
Those could've been lies
I don't think they were lying
mm they could be
they could be
But you know
CVS not the most trusted source
I mean I trust CVS
do
I mean I don't have a reason to not trust CVS
Last year the flu shot experience
that was rough
see
but hat was wasn't
I just didn't trust them for a while because whenever th like you know on the receipts how they give you coupons
mhm
do you say coupons like coupons
Coupons some coupons anyways
I'm collecting my coupons and I'm shopping for what it says on there so I can get the like discounted price then I scanned them and what does it do not work
so you have this like deep set like Mistrust of them
mm
mhm yeah
This is gonna be such a boring conversation for people
We're literally talking about like
coupon
couponing not even extreme couponing just like
I don't think I could be a s extreme couponer
I think I could be
You totally could
I could be
mhm
I'm a fan of coupons
coupons
Thing
Bullshit like why do you give me like coupon things oh
don't you you need a CVS card for them to work
I just remembered that I was like maybe you have to scan that first
Stupid
I bet CVS Doesn't Trust you
why don't they give you those instructions
Oh they better trust me
I also didn't really Know that
I'm a loyal consumer
I went to like use coupons and then I like called someone over and I was like hey the coupons aren't working and they were like okay you have to like scan your CVS card and I was like no like I have these coupons
they were like you need to scan the CVS card for it to work and I was like I don't have a CVS card with me and then he just scanned his and I was like thanks
but yeah but I have these coupons
How's it going
I'm good How are you
I'm good are you from Michigan
No I'm from Washington DC
Gotcha
Yeah
exciting
Yeah
What year are you at school
freshman
me too
Nice What dorm are you in
I'm in Hill
what are what about you
Oh I'm in hodge
ooh
so really far walk
Yes
Hill is actually close to here which is nice
Yeah
Yeah probably gonna stop by hill on the way back stop in my friend's dorm
oho
true
Yeah
who's your what's his name
Her name is Julia
Or her
Julia
I left my backpack there
Oh true
So it's important
Yeah what classes are you taking
I'm taking stats game theory psych and uh composition for film how bout you
oh I'm in psych
that makes sense
English one
Okay
um
I'm in a music as culture class
ooo I almost took that
which is It's cool
but it's like
Yeah mm
I took the composition for film class instead because
A lot of work
Yeah that's at that one I mean I'm not a film person but that does sound cool
Yeah I'm not really a film person either but I like writing music so
Okay
that's the that's the whole class basically
Yeah that's so neat
Yeah
Yeah like the music is culture class we just had an exam and I'm just like
Really
It was not
So you have to keep up with the readings and stuff
ah
ooo
so studying for that was a pain
Yeah that's a tough one
Yeah
I feel like with psych with the keeping up for the readings it takes forever
I know I can't I'm still on chapter nine
I just started chapter nine
It's like I can't I only did I'm on nine one and I like read the first like nine one a but like part B is so long I just gave up on it
Yeah
Are you interested in s like studying psych or like what are you interested in
I wasn't before
kinda just took it on a whim
Yeah
Yeah I'm planning on majoring in applied mathematics and quantitative econ
oh Cool
But I'm not taking any math classes which is a problem
What's game theory though
Game theory is an economics class
Okay
um I thought it was gonna be a math class but I can probably
Try to get it to count for the math
mhm
Um I'll fight for it
Yeah
Yeah
There were like no math classes available when I was when my during my registation time
I couldn't get in any of them I was too late
Yeah
yeah
When was your time
think twelve forty five
oh you were later than me I was a twelve fifteen I think
Yeah so like every class was filled up when I looked at it
Yeah
that was nice
Yeah I hopefully next semester is different
or like In two weeks whenever we register
I hope
Damn yeah
It's so weird that it's like November I don't like it
I'm not a huge fan either
Are you doing anything for Halloween
Um I had a little bit of fun last night
Okay
Um probably have a little more fun tonight I have a comedy show tonight
oh that's fun
so that's fun
that is fun
Yeah it's an open Mic but
Where is that
It's in hotung which is in the campus center
Okay
cool
Yeah it's exciting out outside of that not doing much tonight
Yeah
Yeah which psych class are you in
I'm in the twelve o'clock one
I'm also in that one
There's so many people in it
There's too many people I keep meeting new people from it and I'm like really you're in this class
it's so many people you just blend in
Even worse was when I found out that guys live across the hall from me are in that class and sit in the rowbehind me
uhuh
Really
Like every class and I
Where do you sit in the room
like closer to the front ish
Okay
uh Like two like second or third row
Okay I'm always in the back left I don't know why I always I'm like the last one there I like never get front
that helps no it's not a psychological reason
No
I don't think so
Yeah that's exciting I don't know I kinda like the way that class is taught
Yeah
oh and they're
I like how it's both of them
Yeah
they're both so cool
Because I feel like I'd get tired of it if it was the same person every day lecturing me the same way
Yeah
Like it keeps us off balance it's nice
Yeah definitely
and they lecture so differently which is nice too
I now it's the videos the other day were so funny
yeah
that helps every time they show the office I'm like have you seen that episode
they were
I haven't seen the office
it's worth watching
I've watched
It's worth I just started it like two weeks ago
I want to watch it but I just like don't have time
Yeah
It'll be a summer thing
See I watched like one episode a day so I'm
oh
Maybe two
And they're quick right they're like twenty minutes
And there's t twenty minute episodes yeah
Yeah
Um I think one of the seasons has all forty minute episodes but it's half the amount of episodes
Okay
So
I don't know why they did that
Yeah that's weird
But
To change it up
No it's a good show cause all my other um shows that I was quote unquote binging um ended so
oh okay
or I finished them already
ohh
So that helps I had been anyone
Yep the office I've I've heard nothing but good things about it
Yeah
I just like don't
I haven't had any bad experience with it yet
Yeah I just don't usually watch like co like funny shows
what do you watch usually
I'm
I like crime shows
oo
and like that sort of thing
like law and order kind of thing
Yeah like law and order like criminal minds
those those are cool shows
They're cool they're weird sometimes
most the time yeah it's well done though
Yeah
yeah they do a good job with it
SVU is a really good
Never watched SVU people tell me to I've never done it never actually gone through with it
It's a good show
I'll have to check it out
If you ever have time
I only have time for one episoode a day of the office so
That's what happened on SVU
And then pretend that's still part of the same episode of the office
Yeah
see if it matches up
exactly
Testing
ugh
Yeah
mostly just too tired to do things now
I know I always nap it's so bad I like never get work done
I didn't wake up till one today
Yeah
Threw me off
We had to I'm on the soccer team we had to wake up
oo
For practice otherwise I wouldn't have gotten out of bed
Yeah I looked outside like when I woke up I'm like is it really one oclock it's kinda dark
It's just like today was one of those days where you can't really do anything
Yeah that made sense
It's just too gross out
tried to go to the gym but when I got there I was soaked so like it ruined the whole gym experience
ugh Like when your shoes are wet
My shoes are soaked right now
You can't do anything
It's terrible
I just reali I forgot that I packed my rain boots so I just pulled 'em out today
Really
Yeah
I don't have rain boots I do have a contact that's hurting but that's okay
oh no
It'll be fine it happens like when I get rainwater in my eye
You know typical things
I know my g ay my contacts I wear contacts too they're a lifesaver
I hate when I hate glasses
Yeah
I hate glasses too but I have 'em in case I need them
Yeah
yeah
One day I forgot to take my contacts out at night
oh
And I woke up my eyes were like totally bloodshot
I hate that
So when I took my contacts out like I just started like with my glasses on
mhm
I went downstairs and someonoe was like are you okay like they thought I was like really in really bad shape I'm like no I just didn't take my contacts out overnight but like people were looking at me really funny all day
Yeah
I t was like are you are you good like my teacher pulled me aside after class
oh no
and asked me if I was um doing okay I'm like yeah I just it's not that big a d it's fine
just forgot my contacts
Yeah
No I like I've done that before and then I wake up and I'm like oh I can see now and then and then it's a disappointment when I would like have to take them out
hmm
What happens
I hate it
It's a miracle
I know
Yeah I don't know contacts are annoying but better than glasses
Yes
Yeah
like I just hate Wallich you can't see everything with glasses
it's the peripheral vision that's thrown off
Yeah and like when I'm like especially when I'm going downstair like walking downstairs with them on
oh Yeah
cause then I
they shake a little bit ansd said
Yeah and like I'll see through my glasses and then I'll also see like
with my glasses off like
Yeah like
When I looked down down like I can't see anything it's just blurry
You'll see like just below anything at it's awful
Then I get thrown off
Even worse so like before I wore contacts like the glasses made sense but now that I've worn contacts f for a good amount of time now When I put the glasses on everything is like so different
Yeah
Yeah like you can't go back
Yeah I do every once in a while because I have to
It's a weird
mhm
But like
It's so weird
Yeah it's like getting your eyes a break or whatever they say but like I I'm like no that's not happening
Yeah it's it is what it is
Yeah
Yeah even worse is like when you go a couple days in a row where you've like stayed up too late and wear the contacts for a long period of time
Yeah
And then like your eyes are just generally bloodshot
I know
It's awful
And I hate the like the dry feeling
Yeah
Like when you keep them in and it's just like they kind of get like stuck to your eye
Yeah yeah
It sucks
One time I um tried to take my contact out my contact must have fallen out though so like I'm just pulling out my eye for like thirty minutes
oh no
I was like panicking because I was at a concert so like I got home and I went to take them Out I just didn't have one of them in they were just must have fallen out
that's so funny
The scariest part is that I drove home like I drove home with only one contact in and don't even notice
That's so weir is there what's your prescription is it that
it's not that bad but I have like a really bad astigmatism
uh huh
so
Okay
I should noticed it would've thrown me off
but I don't know
That's funny
I I didn't notice
Yeah I couldn't do that my eyes are too bad
Yeah
I like
Happens
I wanna get Lazic but it scares me
It was a little scary
it's a lil s
Putting lasers in yeah
I know I'm way too scared not till I'm way older
Yeah I was scared of contacts forever if I contact like six months like
oh really
I had like an enormous unnecessary fear for like poking my eyes
That's so i interesting
um Like I had nothing to cause the fear
Uh huh
I just had that fear
That's so weird
Uhm but then I was like fuck it I'll get contacts and that's definitely on video
Like the con it's like the conditioning or whatever
yeah finishing
Yeah
yeah
That's so funny I got it when I was like
Ten
Nine or ten cause I needed 'em for soccer cause like I couldn't
Yeah I should on that
my makes sense
I didn't want to wear the like goggles
see I just wore the my regular glasses when I played soccer when I was younger
uh huh
and they would always like fall off or I'd get hit in the face the ball
Yeah
like I couldn't do headers like
Yeah
I lost a whole point of the game
Exactly
Actually every sport I played a somehow at some point either break a pair of glasses or get hit in the face or like
Yeah
something always went wrong
Yeah
yeah
that's so f
except for cross country I never had problems with glasses in cross country
No
do you still do are you still playing any sports
uh no I'm really good at getting hurt
No
What have you at what are you injured
I've injured like everything you can name a bone or place in my body I've hurt it
oh gosh really
It's yeah most likely doing something clumsy not even not even playing sports
That's f
Like I had three concussions in a month once
not good
I don't play any contact sports
what
Yeah
how
well first one I got in choior
Okay
Um my friend accidentally hti me in the head
oh gosh
So it was a small one the day I came back from that concussion someone hit me in the face with a basketball just like down like in the hall um the day I came back from that concussion I tripped and fell hit my head on a metal pole
That's such bad luck
Yeah it's fine I mean it's tough I couldn't have lost that much brain cells
My friend had one and she was out of school for like two months
Damn
it was terrible
Was a sports concussion though
Yeah so she was heading the she's a center back
That makes sense
Okay
And she was heading the ball and like it hit her too high up instead of on the forehead
that makes sense
And she lost s like it was during our junior junior year of high school and she couldn't play or she couldn't she stopped playing after she got the concussion cause she was too afraid and then she like it affected all her like ACTs SATs and like all of our classes
Yeah
that's awful
She made it to Duke so I think she's doing okay
I think she's doing fine
Doesn't really matter
yeah
It worked out
at least it worked out
Injuries suck though
Yeah I hate getting injured
Yeah I'm sca I've been knock on wood I've been fortunate enough not to have
is this wood
I don't even know not to have major stuff but like even like little injuries I've had a concussion before
Yeah
But
none of my c my three concussions were major so like
Yeah
I was out of school for like a week each
uh huh
um but the three in a row was what the problem was
Yeah that sets you back a lot
yeah
it's okay it was my freshman year so I was I didn't have that much to do
oh
that's not bad
Yeah
Are you doing any like other activities
um
at school
I tried to do acapella
Okay
Didn't get in
okay
Um try to do the cheap socks didn't get into that
What
it's improv
what's that
it's improv
oh okay
um so now I'm in comedy
Cool
um which is I guess the third tier thing
Yeah that's so fun
so yeah
So cool
it's exciting
Yeah
is it like new for you or have you done comedy before
I'm
I've done comedy before just it's been a while
uh huh
Like I did comedy when I was like thirteen
Okay
and like before I had any idea of what was actually funny
Yeah
um So now it's different like I'm writing jokes like all the time
uh huh
now cause it's just finally I'll think of something funny and I'll write it down where as before I wouldn't think to write that down I would just like
Yeah
Think of something funny
That's so fun
that's so interesting
So
yeah even better is when I actually have the tell the jokes um because sometimes I'll just write down a a key word
Yeah
like a like a word that if anyone read it like they would have no idea what I possibly mean by that
Yeah
and then sometimes I'll forget what they mean
Uh huh
and it ruins the whole joke I'll just be like binoculars I don't know that joke is like
Is it like scripted when you do it or is it more
Some of it's scripted mostly not though it's mostly like I've written like part of a joke down and I'll like no matter how I tell it that's the joke is
Okay
I try to write as little as possible down so I can like consolidate space
uh huh
Um but other jokes have to be scripted because I can't be told otherwise
Yeah so like tonight when you go to the thing will you like have a set like something like prepared for it or is it more just like you'll go up there and
I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to do it memorized
Okay
um but I have a s I have a set prepared kind of
Yeah
um I haven't really memorized it but I should start doing it some point
In the next hour
Or so
Yeah I'll figure it out
yeah
I haven't done a show memorized yet
mhm
so I wanted to do one
feel like that would be hard it's more important I feel like to get the joke down
Yeah
Right maybe
I'll probably be telling jokes I've already told tonight
I don't know
Yeah
Um but it's a new audience so they haven't heard 'em
That's cool
Yeah
Never heard of that here I'll have to go sometimes is every week
I don't know um it's this week for sure
it's not been every week
mhm
uh you should go tonight
I would but we have a team dinner thing
that makes sense
um   Sports
We have a playoff game tomorrow
really
So if we l lose our season's over but if we win
you win you get another game
we're s
Yes we get another game
Yeah
Which is nerve wracking but exciting hopefully we do well
that works
good luck
Thank you
what position do you play
I'm a forward
Forward okay
I got I just got moved I was playing outside mid all of high school and like outside back
Okay
And then on this team I'm just better fit up top
that works
like I like the ball at my feet
And like
that makes sense it's soccer
Skills and stuff yeah I'm not like our outside minis are more runners
Okay
Like
Yeah
Just can go up and back all day and chase people down and that's just not
Yeah
My best like that's not my skill set
Yeah I mostly played outside many when I played soccer or goalie
Yeah
so
oh goalie
Yeah a goalie for awhile
That's neat
but they make uh I was in the travel team to me another better goalie
uhuh
from a different town who joined
oh okay
so I didn't play goalie after that
Yeah
uh cause I cann't compete this kids ridiculously good at goalie he got recruited so
oh cool
um
But I quit way before that
Yeah
Yeah
How long did you play
I played for like five or six years but I quit when I was like fourteen
oh cool
okay
Like just before high school
Gotcha did you play any sports in high school or no
Um I did cross country  um
Okay
Because I'm good at getting hurt I wanted to find a sport I couldn't get hurt in
Yeah
I was wrong
No
Now
oh I feel like they'd kill your body
or anyone's body
Yeah
it was tougher than I thought
yeah
Um I was a good cheerleader though on crutches
What do you do what you heard
um
The last time I ever did cross country um I got a stress fracture in my right foot and double shin splints
My gosh
so
The shins ones I feel like I've heard are probably the worst thing
yeah
Shin splints hurt but aren't like dangers injury wise
Yeah like they can't get worse
just yeah
they're not gonna get any worse
They're just painful
the worst that could happen
Like is if you like hit your shin on something while you had shin splints
mhm
then you could get a fracture cause your shins are weaker
Yep
but it's mostly just pain
mhm
Where was this the stress factor
so
In my foot name is was in the um
Okay
I'm not a lateral something on my foot
mm
it was fine
I know a lot of girls who've gotten stress fractures like from over use and that sort of thing
Well yeah um when you run every day eventually Eventually it hits too much in some people
oh It's too much
Yeah and our feet feet are so important
Yeah you know you forget how how easy it walking is until you're like hurt
Yeah
like I
at the time like I thought everything was normal and then I got hurt and I was like shit it's so slow like I was so slow getting places
Yeah
I hated that like I'd be late to class and be like our I'm like I'm on crutches give me a break
Yeah like you take it for gra it gets taken for granted
Yeah I don't know it is what is
Yeah
um b
I've learned a lot from being hurt
Yeah
oh resilience and stuff like that
Definitely it's a big it's very important
I've learned how to quit things that I can't do without getting hurt
mhm
like cross country
Cross country
Yeah
I don't know I'm n I don't know anybody on cross country here
I also don't
Feel like there's a couple swimmers in my hole
Okay
a f couple football players some basketball basketball players
kay
Feel like Hill has a lot of athletes just cause it's like stays open through the winter
Yeah
That makes sense
But I don't know
People in Hodge like cause like one of my friends across the hall plays lacrosse but his roommates on the sailing team
Okay
okay
And um another person down the hall is on the guys soccer team
oh do you know his name
Um his name is Sebastian

Maybe next summer you guys can try again
Next summer

He just couldn't sleep

they're so big so the doubles are nor like p a Wonderful size
Yeah
but ours is just like the exact same size but with three people living in it so it feels way smaller so like we have a lofted bed with she's all our stuff underneath and then we have our bunk bed
mhm
and I was the last of the rooms so on the top of the bunkbed
mmm
which kind of sucks but it's kinda cozy up there
that works
It just sucks cause I can't fold my laundry
oof
It's hard to do that
Yeah I don't I I feel like living in Hill has a lot of benefits
mhm
like room size being one of them
Yeah
Like she probably don't feel like it's that forced of a triple like there's still plenty of space in your room
Yeah exactly like it's not like claustrophobic by any means
Like I can reach from the end of my bed to the end of my um roommates' bed
Like because the like
like cause the way it's set up at this point like it's not that far it's like three feet
mhm
Did you get the third bed moved out
Not yet
Um because apparently you're supposed to pay for that
what
I thought that was silly but I don't know I'm still talking with res life about it
mhm That's ridic
They haven't gotten back to me
The guy who moved out should help you out with that
Yeah we'll figure it out um worst case scenario we don't move it out because we've been using his storage space
Okay
So
That's nice though
not a big deal
Yeah
Worst case scenario it's nothing happens so
Yeah
wa we've been living fine in the first place
mhm It works out
Yeah the Hills dorms are just huge
I know
like my friend's in a single there and her room's bigger than mine
She's in a single
Yeah
That's so nice
I wouldn't ever want to live in a single
I feel like singles I don't know I at least as a freshman I definitely wouldn't want to
Yeah
But in some ways they're nice to just be like
It's nice to have the privacy but like you lose that already key scial output
Yeah
Yes
So
Like I feel like it's harder to make friends maybe
Yeah little bit
I don't know
Not a big deal
Yeah do you like uphill or d well you're down hill so do you eat at
Yeah
I eat at Dewick mostly
you like dewick
I like Dewick
I'm sure you get Carm
I like Dewick so much better
Dewick is better better it's that's known
But Carm is just like so much more convenient
I think we should start calling Dewick just just Mcby just throw people off
Change it up
I mean it wouldn't change the person is just what it is
Yeah that's funny
Yeah
people would be so confused
I got people call south um Harleston cause somebody else put money into it
I know
Um but most people still call it south
Yeah
Like I feel like Macphie's being left out
Everyone knows it's south
Yeah
Yeah
Poor McPhee
Poor Macphie
Yeah
no this is it one person or is it two
I think it's two people
Yeah
like Dewick isn't the first name
um
No
It's Dewick
I don't think Dewick's a first name
they're both the last name
No my name is Dewick that's that'd be weird yeah
no
Dewick MacPhee I don't know
I don't know what it's d do
That's like there's so many Tisch buildings
Yeah
Like there's the library and then the gym
All the Tisch family's the Tisch family's ridiculously wealthy
Yeah
Like they own the they own the New York Giants
Okay
So like if they can own a sports team they can buy buildings at all these colleges
Yeah
Like almost every major college like has a Tisch building of some kind
I just don't get what the purpose of that is
Like investing their money into schools
Yeah
Higher education
Yeah
I don't know that's what their that's what they believe in
that's Nice
Some people believe in investing in like more and more real estate to make more money they believe in investing in peoples' futures
mhm
That's cool
By building Nice gyms
didn't think about it that way
The gyms
yeah
Keep the s Tufts students healthy
let's fight obesity let's put a giant hill right here
That'll help
So after you work out you have to walk up hill again
Might have killer calves
oh yeah
That's the whole goal
ugh
like if I had a set three goals for my entire time at Tufts the top three goals would all be to get killer calves
I feel like wa I have to every time I'm our field is down hill
Okay
so like everyday the walk from
Craft to Hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far
Yeah
And three days a week I have French right after practice
ooo
so either way I'm going like all the way to Olin
it's far
and it's just miserable
It's so far
Yeah
especially now that it's cold it's pretty bad
but Being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class like you're at the same level as the classes like I have to walk uphill to every class
Yeah
That's true
and have enough of a break time in between classes where I have to go back to my dorm to like do like do work and do things
mhm
Yeah
And then go back to class so I'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum
Yeah where are most of your classes
um probably like they're in the academic quad mostly
Okay
But um it's nice I have one class in Granoff so
uhuh
I don't have to walk very far for that
That's nice yeah mine is I've one in Granoff too and then
I have one in Eaton so that's Kinda
Okay
I don't know what that counts as
think it's still the academic quad
Yeah and then Olin and then psych
Yeah
So
Not bad
Not bad
it works out
Yeah I feel like if I were coming from Hil Oli like going to Olin and going to psych would be so easy
Yeah
But like Eaton in Granoff doesn't really ap matter
Yeah Granoff's really easy for me
It would be the same from anywhere
yeah
cause it's like a one minute walk from Hodge
Yeah I have four classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays
Really
But then on I have no classes Wednesday and I only have one class on Monday and Friday so it's like a weird like I a pretty much always have a four day weekend
that works
Which is nice
Yeah I set up my classes differently I have two on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday
Okay
And then I have one recitation on Friday
That's nice
um so it works out
that's really evenly broken up
Yeah and I thought that would be beneficial it's not
You don't like it
it just means I have work due every day
yeah that's what I like about having Wednesdays off
mhm
cause like I don't really have to do stuff Tuesday night
Yeah
But like I can if I wanna get ahead and then I don't have to do anything Thursday nights
That works
Like I would do it again I think but I also end up wasting a lot of time cause my classes like if I don't I don't have class till six PM on Monday
so I end up just like sleeping in too late
Really
But you get you get you get
Yeah I mean I have class at nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays I hate that
Yeah
And it's so early
I have yeah I have I have that too
And it's weird cause like I had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school
I have English
mhm
Like I thought that was early and I think this is early even though it's later
Yeah like getting up at eight
I think it's
like I get up at eight for my nine ams
Yeah
I feel like next semster I'm gonna try and go for everything after ten
yeah for sure
Especially cause now like at least first semester I can't have any classes between three and five six three and six so like I have the that whole chunk of time likeI couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now I'm more flexible
that makes sense
Yeah cause of soccer sports yeah
Yeah but I'm still trying to have Wednesdays off it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week
it breaks up the week yeah that would be that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off
Yeah it's like you don't like Fridays off are nice but having one class on Fridays isn't the end of the world
no I have a rescitation that's not mandatory
Yeah
and like its
what for what class is it
for stats
Okay
Um I only have to show up if like when I pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance
mhm
Okay
Um so that helps
yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta
e yes except for stats which has three
Including rescitation
Okay
okay
But yeah it's nice
Yeah
One of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes
Uhhuh
And he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class I mean
Yeah
and Like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either
mhm
on Fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory
oh my gosh I'm worried for next semester cause I'm trying to take five classes
Same though
And then like most of them like if I take econ I'll have a rescitation
Okay
French two will have a rescitation
Yeah
I wanna take computer science
I do too but I don't know when I want to take it
I know
Like I want to take next semester but I feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it
I know
I don't it want to be a super busy clas I want to be able to like learn well for that class
Yeah
I've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all
well I don't know which is which
I know I need to figure it out too my one friend was like
Rate my professor
Yeah
work works really well
that is a good one
my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever
Yeah
That works
So we'll see
Yeah
Yeah
I don't know
I I just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was
Yeah that's how I feel
But
I took four pretty easy classes
Yeah me too
Or classes that don't have a lot of work
Yeah
so ah
Like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually
It;s reading heavy
it's reading heavy
which takes a long time but isn't that hard
Yeah and like I feel like my notes I'm so particular about how I take my notes that it takes even longer like
Do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read
So I like have tried everything like oh I used to go paragraph by paragraph which I know you're not supposed to do
mhm
but so then like this past time for chapter eight I would read through
All of eight point one like eight one A B C or whatever and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like I knew like I didn't have to re read each paragraph
I kinda knew what was going on
Okay
Um but that took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four
Really
Like I sat in Tisch from seven to eleven
Damn
doing psych [ ]
that's that's tough
And it's like it's such a it's like not a waste a time but like I could have been I feel like there's got to be a better way to do it
See I don't take notes at all when I read cause I'll just get distracted by it like I'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading
Yeah
and I won't learn as much from it
uh huh
I like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book
Yeah
and I'll go back and do those after
Just so I really master it
Like the the quizzes or the
Yeah like a flash cards and quizzes I can go back and do those
Yeah maybe I'll try that for chapter ten
Yeah
Like I just feel like if I get through chapter nine I'll be fine cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning
yeah
Yeah
And then I'll just be able to like I can just review extra for it
Yeah
for test on Thursday
That works it's the balance that I just take like really like really affected notes in class
Yeah
or I'll write down more than I necessarily
Yeah
but just so I have it
Yeah
Yeah
I feel like
My class notes could be better but it's also like I I feel like I don't pay as much attention in class because I know I have the reading to fall back on
Okay yeah
But like that's not good like I need to be paying attention in class but we'll see
I get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture I'm like okay I I I g I not really getting right now just like go for further reading
Yeah
Um in the sometimes right the opposite world like I'll read it after like a lecture and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this do
this doesn't make as much sense anymore
mhm
Yeah
so but it is what it is I got
Yeah
It's really just studying for exams and learning the material
Yeah
exactly and like the I feel like this exam will be a little easier to study for
well not that we've seen the exam questions
Yeah
from the first one we know how to do it
Yes and like it's not as much it's not as specific I feel like the material
Yeah
it's more theories and like vague stuff
A little more vague
whereas like last time we had to know like all the different functions
yeah
and I was like lots of flash cards with that one
I spend so much time just making flashcards and then I found out they had like the flash cards built in
I know
And I was like really did I just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason
That's all my friends did the same thing and I just like I ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before like I took super diligent notes
which made it easier
mhm
but I'm not doing that this time like I need to start studying tomorrow
You know I promised myself I'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time
Uh I didn't cause I just finished chapter eight so
Yeah I finished chapter eight on Thursday
I finished it
Wednesday Thursday
Yesterday so that was Friday
Yeah
Yeah
And chapter nine and ten are apparently really long
There's like five and six parts each
Yeah and like the within the individual sections like they all scroll
Yeah
for a really long time and I'm just like I can't do this
so much
Do you ever watch the videos
Yeah um if it seems like a short chapter
Yeah
I feel like an actor now
yeah
This is like this room's like set up like I literally feel like I'm being like interviewed
Yeah
When will CNN recognize me
This is a news cast
If I like had to um I think like I don't know I feel like in a d very dream world I would be an actor
I don't I think like if I had talent in that aspect I would be an actor like
I feel like my ultimate life goal would be in like a really like a well known movie franchise
Yeah
Like I don't know I feel like a life goal for me would to if I was an actor would be to be in the MCU or like Star Wars
Like
Like something like I could
Like job security
Yeah like job security
like there's gonna be there's gonna be at least eight movies
I know also like cultural impact toolike
Yeah
like literally everyone knows who like Carrie Fisher is
Yeah
like I don't know it's they're like really recognizable people they're like very iconic but also
mm
I feel like the only problems like people think like oh you're just you're just like this character
you're
like Harry potter
Yea
Like Daniel Radcliffe can't get another job
And honestly like I guess wait what's who's Hermione Granger
Emma Watson
Emma Watson has done a better job breaking out
I know yeah
But I feel like Daniel Radcliffe just gave up
mm
and started doing weird movies
Maybe that's why
And Broadway
Or maybe he just enjoys doing that better
Yeah maybe he does enjoy doing weird movies
I don't know I feel like Emma Watson's more main stream
Yeah she is
Although I feel like it's easier for like female actors to like get
More roles I guess
Maybe
I don't know
Maybe it's because all female roles are so similar to each other
That's true don't have to be that diverse
Yeah
What happened to Ron's actor like
Oh he was in a the last time I saw him was in an Ed Sheeran music videoyeah
really
Was he like an Ed Sheeran clone
Yeah
What
That that was literally the the premise I'll show you after this
oh my god
the premise was like he
He's like a crazy Ed Sheeran fan
What
And he's like trying to steal his identity or something something like that I don't know
But can he sing though
I don't
It's very strange
Oh my god
Yeah
mm
I wo̲nder li̲ke what's gonna h̲appen to like all the a̲ctors̲ like a̲fter they leave like major fra̲nchises c̲ause they still like I don't know cause it's either like they m̲ake i̲t r̲eally̲ big
mhm
or they don't at all or like or they like th they're like so we̲
yeah
they're not that bi̲
or like
are you talking about like D̲isney stars cause you have
I YEAH definitely
you have people like Zendaya
mhm
who I lo̲ve and everyone loves
yeah
and then you have Bella Thorne
who's like
is like
WHAT
what is happening but they were on the same show
I know
And they both play like pretty memorable characters
Are you Selena Gomez made it
Just
Wait a go as
He's like
Is just cute she does she can't even say
She's
But at least she's got his somewhere now
Yeah she's definitely made it W of auto is very talented had a one to five psych S very talented
Whatever they're doing now is I don't know it
I've I wonder how people feel like looking back like if if we could get like a really honest like interview
mm
like I wonder like Like well they act what do they actually think about like being a Disney star
Yeah the
Yeah I think like like Miley Cyrus has talked about toxic it is
mm
especially so she did it with such at such a young age and with her dad was like super toxic for her and then I don't know I feel like she did it so well like she break out of the role so well
mhm
because she like she had the phaser everyone was like what are you doing
I think I remember reading like online like like some people are it's like discussing like oh like discussing like Miley Cyrus is like crazy stage in like now heard like so she's like normalize now
Yeah
I think they're talking really um like like the crazy stage was definitely like a marketing ploy like a publicity stunt
Uhuh
because like the whole point of it I think they said was like to like change her image from
Yeah
From like a child star to like being taken more seriously
I think that so I definitely think there right
Yeah
The Disney conspiracies Hey
I know
Selena Gomez and have to but she wasn't as iconic as Hannah Montana
I guess here
yeah
I think that's it
I feel like it wasn't was it it's a way early place like more recent
Yeah it was more recent still gotcha
I like never watch Disney channel's a child so like so like all the classic I Kotick ones like I don't really know them
Of really
Yeah
I found the clips online just to be relevant
I don't know yeah I was like in my sociology of girls class we read this really interesting article about how like
Like a races like very neatly depicted on like Disney shows and stuff
oh really
Yeah because like I don't know because you know you didn't you never watch was it's we really place right
What I saw like I saw like
Thank random episodes are just like a random like
mhm
clip server it so like I know like who the characters are for like I'm not that familiar with like
Yeah
The actual show
Yeah it's like cuz it that like they could like reference like they're Italian heritage and like they're like static heritage and then also like I feel like that's so raven did you watch that's so raven
No I but I know of it
Yeah
It's like the one where she's like psych a great
Yeah
She could see into the future
Yeah I don't remember the exact content I need to look back because I need to write this paper
So what what what the paper like say like about how races like depicted
I don't know those I don't remember really very well it was like it was just like
Hello everyone understands like like even though you didn't have Disney Channel you still know the shows and stuff you still know the characters
mhm
um
I don't know
I think that's just like part of being a kid though because like like all you talk like oh like did you see like um did you see like the new episode like last night of like level are show
Yeah
I mean I feel like that's like I feel like it's the same with like adult shows know except I feel like
mm
Like not
Netflix
Yeah now kids like they have Netflix so it's like more accessible than if you like only had cable
Yeah and also like if you think about it shows like the office caroling a long time ago but now kids are watching
Yeah like a
I know
So weird
My brother was talking about like like um like how looks like sometimes like now in the morning on the weekends would you like to leave a get out of it he just literally watches entire seasons of the office it's
It's that's a that's a mood
I miss high school
I know when you like you didn't have to actually get out of bed
Yeah when you like I guess because you didn't have a roommate
That's
So known good actually judges
Yeah I feel like if I stayed in bed all day my roommate would definitely touch
Genevieve wood we like are you sick like what's
Yeah
Requires you functioning human being the whole time I've been hiding them
I cannot like I don't think I can physically like watch TV that log for like
mm
four hours straight
I certainly feel really like rocky
Here the
Yeah
Also a knuckle I like even like part way through it up the so like I kinda get Sir to get bored
Really yeah
Yeah
Does a show
I can't do like I can't really do sit carbs because most of time like
oh
like I hate crew G humor like
I hate laugh tracks
Like I I feel like a currency humor so much I'm just like I need to like get up and like Walker out to so I could like deal with this courage
The second hand embarrassment
I know
It's like oh my god like how can you read the still
I didn't really get bothered by laugh tracks until a solid
Like means about it online about how annoying they were and then I could never on notice
mm
Yeah like I always see them now it's like
Yeah
they're not that necessary
Yeah
I used to love the Big Bang theory and then I realize like how about it
oh
it's not I think that if you think about the purpose of the show that is not even like out great I guess
Yeah
and also like they pointed out a lot of problematic is about the characters like
Yeah
Like why is penny so stupid and
Yeah
Yeah
I just like like I wonder like it what the Sheldon's actor feels about the role
Yeah
because it's like it's a very like I don't is like the most well known character out of all of them
Yeah
But like he's not exactly like
I could
In known like known like for
Yeah
For being a good character
Yeah
He's done like the act I really like the actor he's only other stuff like he was in the Muppets movie
all
what
Of and then he's also playing like
Uhm there's a show that's coming um not there's that movie that's coming out it's about
Transmission standard kid
mm
and he plays a father
So all
Yeah
This thing
Yeah
I don't know I feel to  although to be honest if you're like on a TV show that makes a lot of money I I would understand why people would not want it to like want to leave it
Yeah yeah
Because you have to ride the train as long as it makes money
Ride the train
True like
But then you also have to like stop before you go down hill
That's true I feel like you have to leave like at a good point like I heard awesome
Like the lead character from the walking dead hit the actors leaving the show
Which one
oh the lead
Here the lead character
Oh um the one with the
The beard yet yeah that guy
Fair yeah
Of
Well he says he gonna get killed off so I was going to work
I don't know um I don't know because it's like I feel like I mean like I I've heard the walking dead has gone really downhill
Yeah
Uhm for like I feel like because like every time like the actors like leave the show that they like kill the off
Yeah
I think that I think I've only seen one episode like one actual season of the walking dead season five
mm
but like the only character like I really liked when I watch it was um Stephen young's character
Oh and rest in peace
Yeah rest in peace
I I just know that like
Like they've gotten too crazy
mhm
I think it's just like
And the premise
I mean I guess there's not a lot you can do in the long run
The thing is like a zombie like people living in the zombie apocalypse would not have survived for as long as a season
Like I repressed it there's still that many people in like the issue human her hold
yeah
Yeah we have like a baby to or something
I know they had a Beatles like that baby's gonna like die
Yeah have you seen the quiet please
No but I like know that the plot and roughly
The Pharmacia
Yeah
They have like a baby like
What the hell
Tearing that link how
Like honestly though like because like it's like the mother die s like how you're going to feed the baby that
Oh true I don't think about that
And also like babies are loud like how did those monsters like not kill a all the
that's the thing
That that is the
As a problem in the movie
Is like how do you keep the baby during this
I e
like a real all you did like when that when I felt when I heard they had like a baby carriages like how did this all these like not kill the baby like already
Yeah
because like yes so loud you have to like
Carry it everywhere
I know I know I feel like I'm like I feel like to be like close up of apocalyptic plots are like the most interesting because like I've always like
mm
all like how like societies gonna fall apart or like how people are gonna like recover
that's so dark
I know but I'm I feel like they usually make for like really good promises in like
Like simulations kind of
But yeah like movies are like video games
mhm
but like I feel like um
Doesn't like Kerio like that I'm not for me I don't really like reading like reading about it
Oh
Like like it us in a book for
Yeah
But like I like group and I kind of look like see in person &la ughs just because like to see how it's all his realized
Of like because there's a Lotta world building
Yeah there is
When it comes so that there's some good books that really did it well that I couldn't put down
But yeah I tried reading have you heard of annihilation
Oh yeah I've heard of of it
Yes like a book that they turned into a movie
mhm
movie looks pretty good but I try to read the book and I was like I can't get pass
What is it what is it about
Uhm basically like the world is like it's like one of the I think it's one of those things where it's like all the city is a safe place
mhm
but like once you leave the city it's like there's a lot of stuff going on
mhm
but basically it's like
It's almost like like weeds like these plants and stuff like
All the organisms are like like altered and like weird and like distorted
What
Outside in the world so like they sent this woman like her husband gets sent out
mhm
to like research it and explore it but he like
He like comes back like really different or something and so they think like it's not him it's actually like a copy of him that the outside world made
oh
Suit like they sent a bunch of like other researchers out or something
And the yeah are you ever gonna watch it the end of the movie is really trippy
I heard something about a bear
Oh a bear
I don't know I don't I don't remeber what animal it was Like I remeber being a lot of people are like kind of like like discussing oh like what is like the most trippy trippy thing you've seen in a movie or like what's and people were like talking about like Annihilation and they were like there's like some bear some animal
Oh really
I don't know
I want to wash it
Yeah
Just for the pen her that's like the bear in the
The one that Leonardo di Caprio was
All the revenue
Yeah
I still don't know that's about like I heard he was like
F
Really extreme stuff to get into the role
I think he I think he only had
I think I don't know if this is happen in the movie I think he l ike kill the bear and to stay warm he crawled inside is
What the fuck
What the very get like cold both because it's dead
What it's still furry
I guess
How do you call it's
I had um artistic event I guess it to slit it open and get inside
I guess
Such as gross
Who comes up for these parts
Yeah or maybe it maybe I Just imagined
Like
Wait I don't know honestly who because of these gotta plots like like man gets trapped in wilderness crawls into bear to stay warm you watch that for two I hope
Now I'm not we now I'm like questioning is that actually happens
I
Know that it definitely it that movie definitely happened
I also heard like that was like some of the critique the critique about gravity like it was just like two straight hours of like
Oh well
Whatever hurt the actress's name however the actress was just like like floating around in like not really talking or something
Yeah oh that was some also it's like all CG I feel like people like
Yeah
Kind of miss
Of
Also what was that movie oh Dunkirk
Is that their World War one one
There is
He yeah what we're what We're we're too
What's Your styles one
Yeah Harry styles
Wait was it World War one or World War two
I think it was World War one right
One yeah
Yeah
yeah I don't know I liked it but there was n̲o talking at all
what really
yeah
it was like a w̲ar film
mhm
solidly a war film like
s but there was like n̲
yeah like there was like it was all
like there was no d̲i̲alogue y̲
so o but was like the ↓dialogue implied like like I don't know if like a general said like oh like here's our orders to like go attack thi̲s area like was that impl
oh oh
like I guess t
move the plot
mhm
or like h w was essential to the plotit was like very like realistic̲
mhm
it would just be like oh like very bare minimum what needs to be said
oh okay
yeah
Interesting
Yeah really liked it oh really Harry styles
He like upgraded
Yeah he really all he had to do was get a hair cut
I know I think like whatever watch movies I focus more it like
Like I don't know what I see
Yeah
But like I always miss like intentional like stylistic things
Oh like I mean that's like any art form I see I feel like you need
mhm
he needs to be accessible to someone who doesn't have a degree and a
Yeah
I know because I feel like I've I like fixate more like the characters then like
mm
everything else in the movie
Yeah
Yeah it's like
It's like do you should you watch movies for the plot or the character development
Like borrow like even like I know I can still like insure movie people if you people say it's bad
Oh really
Yeah cause like I don't know like I enjoy it like despite the fact that it's bad because like I don't know I found it like fun like our um I think like last year like during I don't know maybe during thanksgiving break like me and a few friends
mhm
from high school we watch the room
oh the room
in
Yeah and we were like
Oh
We were like so confused but like I don't know I kinda liked it cause it was so bad
Wait the original the not the disaster artist right
Yeah the original
Oh my god
I was like so confused I was like wait what's going on like why like what is it what like what where where is this story going
I feel it that's why is a cult classic because it's so bad
Nine
I know
Like some video on YouTube described it like it's like if an alien walk like if you show to alien and explained in el did alien like what movies are but like the alien tried to be cool Knowing a lot of movie act without like actually understanding like how the movie like it's like why movie can be like how a successful movie you operates it just like you ex lately go a movieneeds fought like characters it needs some plot it needs like
And it's like this This like drama that happens here
A setting
yeah
it's like I don't know I like don't understand like that will be at all
It's like I'm
Putting in putting something into Google translate
mhm
taking the translated part and then putting it on the other side again so to translated again back into the original this is like not
oh my god
Yeah like whatever it whatever this is is like not like I don't even know
But I heard like
I heard like the guy who directed it was like this he had like a weir d backstory
Yes No like
Cuz like a model
Him I don't know it's like Tommy was those like
Yeah the
Like nobody knows like what we're he's from like
Yeah
is that it's is just like showed up one day in the
He had funny in a because um V
He had money he had a weird accent that
Yeah
No one really knows where it came from
I know like thank
It's like low key shady as hell
Yeah but you know as an actor you probably do need he
This is true
I one I feel like those actors the rest of the actors are probably like I can't believe I've like
That's
participated for the I believe I I can't believe I participated in this
Record RP Mike
But they got it do it right like state
I don't I mean I feel like
Like the act is seriously
The other actors weren't even like that but though
Yeah because they were the people that can make it other roles
Hello it's like like they're not good actors
Yeah
And the fact that they were in the room only made it made like later on worse I guess
Have you seen the disaster artist
No but it's like
A good
It's so slow to explain the backstory right
Yeah it's like based on like
The guy who is this friends who like coat did stuff with him um it's like based on his biography
oh
Yeah
So I guess like
If you I read about it
Thanks I guess there's like some I mean obviously it like the Fred fall be like hit a bunch of stuff
Yeah of
For just like we don't like how the entire truth
Yeah
Still doesn't make sense even if we have to check
That's true to be fair like a lot of directors make like interesting choices
Yeah yeah
Like Michael ray explosions
That's just throwing money at the CG I had he
Every fair though like the explosions to get a lot of at tention
Yes say that because I know you like movies with lots of explosions
I would like it easily or it you could like easily grab my attention I know I I think I just like movies are like not realistic
Oh
Like I just I like things that are not like set too much in the real world
mm
like I like I don't know I like MCU because it's like it's like in the real world but it's like not
What do you like
Like I I don't know I like I like things like MCU cause
Which
Like the mar
What's MCU
The Marvel cin the Marvel movies
Oh oh yeah
Because like they're like set you you know they're set in the real world but like obviously there's a lot of like fantasy sci fi elements to it
mm
so I guess like um that's why I like it
mm
um
I know also I guess I just like things about
That are not like common experiences
Oh yeah like
Like why would I watch movie that an average person get
Yeah I know like to be on is like I can never really get like to be high and um like movies like
Uhm like about like because like at like everyday people
mhm
I know like I don't I don't really like high school movies because it's kind of like this is it's like it's not realistic but it's it's but like it's supposed to be realistic so it's like I don't know like how to feel
The I think a good enjoy enjoy like mean girls
mhm
because what they do is like the take kind of real things and they just exaggerated out of proportion
I know
It's like more rial I don't
But I guess like those movies probably make more sense like are more like realistic
If you like went to high school and like the early two thousand through the nineties
Yeah
Because the culture is like definitely change like in like the way bullying is for trade it's not like um we're gonna I'll
I'll I'll
He has not like we're going to like I don't know still your lunch money anymore it's like
Yeah the
Psych over gonna like say things about you and like keep posting like things about you
AC into all the boys I've loved the forcibly
What I heard is a really good
Wait you haven't seen it
No
You should definitely watch it like first well Asian lead
Great and also like yeah I mean they portray high school kind of weird but it's like enjoyable because it's not real
Yeah
I think the main issues yes because the actors are so old they're not actual teenagers so they like
The area
So like when you see a like a high school movie it's always like but doctors are you like what twenty or something
I'm like no high school junior senior looked This attracted
You
I know exactly
Not at my school
Like it my freshman look like literal children
Yes the fresher look like children and the seniors look like
Like men
Yeah like it does and I guess it's like really jarring so like not that helpful
Hi
Hi
How are you
good how are you
Good
Are you a freshman
yes
Are you in psych
Yes
You
Yes
I'm
You're a freshmen
Yes I'm in the um first section of psych
Oh the morning one
Yes
ten thirty
yes
Me too
oh you are oh cool
Are you ready for the test
mm mm
me neither
I feel like the last one like I knew
Like s most of the things so like I took anatomy in high school so I was like I know the parts of the brain and then I got to like this test and like I have no idea what I'm going to do
And like for me I really even study that much cause I was used in high school not having to study
Study yeah
And then here
Obviously it wasn't an effective method because I didn't do that great but whatever like I'll just work really hard on this one
Oh exactly
Hopefully get a better grade
Same I like multiple choice for me is like I hate it
It's for me it's like I don't know whether to love it or hate it because sometimes I wouldn't know the answer to the question if it were li ke the multiple choice question without the options
Was it s right right
but at the same time you can't like BS a multiple choice like if you have it wrong it's wrong
Yeah right
So that sucks
and like the short answers like or so much about
But um where you from
I'm from Panama
Oh very cool
You
Do we start
what'd you wanna talk about
Well this is like prison you know the things they have in movies
The like when you talk like
Yeah like somebody's in jail
Yeah it's at first I like I did the thing where I didn't think the glass was actually there I was confused
It looks like a mirror
it's kinda creepy
Yeah it's
so weird
Um what's going on
um
I have no idea
uh I did my math homework today
You did or didn't
I did
Is that not usual
Well it's due today oh I have this really hard problem set that I have no idea how to do  and I've asked everybody I know who's good at math and they can't do it either  and then so Michelle and I were gunna go to office hours today which is why I told you I couldn't come to brea kfast
And then teacher was like not there and very and like we couldn't find her but it's due at six o'clock tonight
so after this
That's fun
yeah I have no Idea how to do it and googling it didn't help
How many more problems do you have to do
It's just one but it's like the triple integral or something I don't know how to do it
Neither do I
Yeah
Yeah I started writing my like three thousand word essay
For what class
For English and I wrote a thousand words and realized that I have nothing else to say
oh that's problematic
So that's fun
What um would be writing about
We had to choose two opteds about um anything we wanted
mhm
so I chose
Is this one
Yeah so I chose one it was such mine were about the UN climate report so one was about um how
Uhm that that your mom again
the
When you know one was like
Like there's nothing we can do like we should just like sit back and wait for like new technology to like be invented and the other one was like  um there's nothing we can really do but we might as well try
mhm
Conflicting arguments or did you fall
I can't give an opinion it's like a writing about the arguments like just I have to write about which argument is presented better
Uhm
So transfer them better
it the one that we might as well try
That's optimistic
I might be a little biased
yeah probably
but
But yeah someone else in the class chose the same one and they chose the other article so
Hello
That's good so it's doubly arguable
Yeah
I have to do
But
oh go ahead
I was just gonna say I'm just really bad at writing essays so
They're done how many pages is three thousand words
I don't know I'm at three right now so
Nine ten
Nine
it's a it's a long essay
It sucks
It's fun
We have to do
And we only had two days to write it was signed Monday night
A really
it's due Wednesday
Well rough draft is due Wednesday
So you really really rough
Yeah and I probably won't finish it like I'm not gonna be able to do it tonight
Why
Because I'm going to the game

Dodgers
Daughters for the daughters from
LA
So like across the coast
I think I hope that I'm not gonna get made fun of forgetting that wr ong
Is your dad is it outlined the red Sox
Uhm ish like none of us are like really into the red Sox but it's like
Kind of like a weird like a emotional attachment like I don't really watch that much but I feel very like it's like my childhood kind of like I was very into them when I was a kid
What changed
Like really close
Really feeling it should be like good at it because of your job
I fiddle when I work

The change your own words
I didn't say that
What did they would use actually say in person
I don't know I don't really say a lot I was very uncomfortable being like interviewed and being recorded
Really
Yeah
One interesting
It was like very stressful because they tried to like returned him is to say like bad things about the other team because we beat them
mm
And I was just like I just don't want to like like this is just weird like I'm not gonna say something bad about them
You also get hot you later like
Yeah I don't want something to do like one I don't to be mean but also I don't like something like Matthew said like they're terrible
mhm
I could be like grown ups a singer and ups
The movie like a long time ago I don't remember it though
I had like the scene where the basketball team and they're all in their forties d been talking poorly of them
Yeah I mean they were kind of the worst but they were mean

I remember them doing something
Who knows
There's a kid on the tennis club tennis team here who is on the rifle team of mine in high school

and it was kind of awful
Who is um who they want to hand over high school or something

Maybe
It's the only pizza place probably
Okay as a kind of like it is like a very college town life has
Yeah I like it
My friend's brother went there in
I'd
They had a f I got free pizza there couple times
go ahead
What do you do
They said if you post on Facebook about this place we'll give you a free pie
Like a whole piece it like it was a public weather
Like us like large part that is shared with my friends
oh that's so not with your family
Well I was with my friends
Well it's good um I'm going to dinner with Cameron on Friday and I' m really excited it's called the Tuscan kitchen I picked up everything I want bu t they have homemade bread
Wait that's not the place so we just passed was it
No no it's somewhere in like in others the north end and then there's like a query and

Italian pasta skin but it's really really good like I've been looking at the things all day which made me really hungry and then for lunch toda y I had leftover pasta pasta from the band koto place a with my parents
I feel like going for county free lobbying vegetarian kinda sucks
No it's just cheese and pasta and cards that's delicious
yeah but there's no meat like any like protein in there
The teeth cheeses protein
Like
not really
There can't get the is there a lot of protein in cheese
Yes it is
Is a reasonable amount of work due to hear better tarian
I wouldn't be a vegetarian I don't know except I got guilted into doing a meatless u m dinner a couple nights ago
Okay tell me
No no I just walked in and they had like the eco reps they were like would you like to commit to being vegan for dinner or like being going meatless for tonight and I was like I don't really want to and they're like oh just to save the environment and I was like
fine
Right that's so aggressive
It was very aggressive
Which I already got
And I'm very bad at saying no to people
Michelle has the same problem
So
Yeah I just like if someone like
Yeah I like
It doesn't hurt your ear
Don't do it
sorry
I don't think it should it doesn't
Bother you might hear
Hurt maybe you have weird ears

How
I thought that when I'm a cartilage piercing
There you go
mm
King of weight so it's on all the
Dewick
But they were debilitated you go
I can't remember I just remember feeling like I really didn't want to do it and then they guilted me into it
oh what did you eat
I ate pasta
see that's
and like cheese pizza
that's like healthy and good food
Not really though no it's not healthy I need like it's just has carbs
I'm not all healthy
Yeah you say it is valid
yeah but that's a lot of effort because you have to like make it and and like just like on it j ust feels like a scoop up like the like like especially when they have like the um
Like stir fry kind of pasta with like broccoli and pasta
oh yeah yeah yeah
And beef it's like
And they may have a chain right and that's just around the side
Yeah
but it's tofu it's weird
Took his good I'd really adobe lasting
It's not good I don't like to foods
Yeah well it's a rolm
Is there anything in tofu does it have any nutritional value
Yeah no it's seven that's full of protein
oh
more you know
that's the whole point
The more you know
why would you eat something that has nothing in it
I don't know you're vegetarian you're weird
I am not
you do all kinds of weird things
what do I do
You don't eat you just eat vegetables
And fish I'll eat fish
oh so you're pescatarian
Yeah
oh okay
but people don't know what pescatarian means
who doesn't know what a pescatarian is
Most you'd be surprised
And um what is that and they go do it check and I was like no I don't and so then I just a vegetarian and then tell you later
so rude
Yeah I'm doing nothing funny
I'll put this away sorry
Yeah
Uhm Tina how what happened to Michelle at Harvard
Yeah
He was talking somebody on our floor today
Sorry hold on
Oh my god you're just a mess
It is one of the men are for how you can you hear me

It goes the other way
No it just goes all the way over
No yeah my muscle their way hold on
Name some
Like
this part goes like
Yeah mine went the other way
Like that
Sure
This is really embarrasing it's gonna be like a video of me embarrassing myself
This is going to find its way to YouTube at some point I bet
there
I can't hear what
I was just making fun of you
oh well I can't even hear and so it's not fair
if yeah what it was still funny
Okay anyway so somebody tried to set up with Michelle with somebody she already knew who she is like not at all into
It is like really really
So she was a little bit let down
Understandably
bummer
Bummer
Yeah definitely
uh
do we have the same this is so weird we have the same this m
The room is like cut in half
this room is
No but it's the same paintings look
No yeah but they're mirrors of each other
I know it's just really weird they're like it's yeah the whole mirror like it's weird
I wonder if it's like supposed to like
s
Freak me out which it kind of is
The trees are perfectly even
Well not perfect but it's pretty close to perfect
okay
just very uncomfortable
Leaving an art piece maybe
Yeah
It was like dollar cycle is that it's an art piece
Yeah
so s
Uhm want us to talk about
Okay are you going out on Thursday night following
Um I told you we have my friends' surprise birthday party
Uhm that is true that's true
But before I'm going to the French house to get extra credit by going to their party first
they've actually is it like a real party
I don't think so
or is it a French party
I'm guessing since my teacher told me go to the French house for a soiree
I mean you could be surprised
Thank
I could be surprised
The French go wild
Um yeah and then we're doing that but I mean we'll probably do some I don't know I need to find a costume
mm
because my co costume's required for the for my skiing thing on Friday
That's required just goes yourself good um goes your brother
you're so creative
You were being uncreative today on the walk over
What do you mean I was being uncreative
I'm gonna buy random clothes I am that guy from that movie
Yeah that's funny
you know
no it's not nobody's gonna get it
I'll g I'll think it's funny
you should
There is some in my school and from high school she did like you kno w those paintings of the pop art type of thing I get very and your dr awings there's like also a photo later but she painted on her fa ce
Okay
And is actually very very cool impressive
That's cool
see I don't wanna do anything that requires effort
oh What's your problem
I just wanna buy clothes that match a costume
oh
usually where the unicorn onesie
oh
Yeah I wonder who yeah that's actually a good idea I'll do that
You're welcome there is an added him to go
So that's kind of a weird first impression to people that I don't know but
It's a costume you can't go wrong a Halloween
True
like you really can't
what are you gonna dress as
I don't know Friday came and fat is not have any open party this week end
why can't you still go
No because it's like he's out of he's a pledge so you'd have like control over it so I'll be going to like I am going to my first tough party
It is exciting
Yeah I think on Friday afterwards we're gonna to go to the data delta chi one probably
be an adult
I saw two that I like saw on Facebook
it's just
It's the like I think it's like X O or something like that it's like the howl at the moon or something like that I don't know
Okay well maybe yeah
It's one of those
There's another one on Saturday I know but I thinkall I'm gunna do like cause I can't go with Cameron caue he has frat stuff most of the weekend
oh
So are you gonna be at Tufts all weekend
Except for Friday yeah
wait what did you just I thought you just said that your
cause I have dinner
oh
mmm
That's like a late dinner but I think grace Meghan Frankie Michelle and I were all gunna do a group costume
and what we came up with yesterday was well my great idea was over the rainbow like we each be color of the rainbow cause there's like five of us
its very five year old but
It's easy and simple and you probably already have it in your closet
They didn't like that idea they allwant to go
Yeah I wonder why
they wanna go thrift shopping
and
yeah that's the most yeah go to Goodwill
no ap̲arently there's one in Davis
what
there's apparently one in Davis
Yes Goodwill
oh is that actually a good will store
oh maybe it's not I thought it was
I thought it was just like another thrift store
there's l
really
oh
yeah
I didnt even know I haven't seen any of them
There's like one that's like there's one good one I forget what they're called one that's cool but it's like actually expensive
The point like not the winter stress
so you don't wanna g
So it's not it's kind of defeats the purpose I mean it's not like expensive expensive but it's more expensive
Okay
And then there's one that's okay
A good cheap but Frank you really wanna do Hippias
His friend he wants to buy a pair of bell bottom jeans I think this will b e good reason to do it I don't I give off a hippie vibe so
eh
Yeah exactly I don't
so we'll see what'll happen
you could do it
Another good idea was it all goes animals because mac and really wanted to be  um a lobster with her boyfriend he's going home for the weekend
Okay wait okay it takes me a second to think of
He
Megan's the tall blonde
The n
I know I just need to like connect names to faces but I got it now
Okay she um he went home for the weekend so that um it's all the animals that is a good dog out and making your lobster and some of the um yea h I have a cat out and they're like wait may like I can't be a lopsided I'm here talking like normal animals
No th lobster's cool
Yeah then my yard shot out the window
Yeah she should yeah she should be a lobster
so that was a shame
Um someone told me I should be a seagull
Uhm that's really creative
Yeah but that's a lot of effort I need to like
no what would you do
you should do I realized that i f he said that
I don't know
DJ
The date that's really creative on DJs part
Its DJ
No I know Billy um I saw him on Friday night and usually walking ar ound it's like hi DJ and he like looks over it's like the like this like t he nicest Italy opossums like
He's such a I love DJ he's funny
I don't know
he got ordained as a minister
No he did not
And married me and this other guy at breakfast because we didn't know what was happening he was just like Hey do you like say I do
And I was like I do and he's like okay great you guys are married
So you're
So
You're legally married down
I'm
well I didn't sign anything
no but I don't think you have to do you have to sign
Yeah no it's not it's not actually a thing
you do
In addition he just signed this or make any your signature
Except we planned he wants to marry Spencer and Simone and he's going to have them sign uh um petition for something
How did DJ get ordained
you apparently it's like really easy just do it online he just like put in his name
but it has it can't be fake
And you got a certificate
it has to be fake
I don't know
didn't that happen oh you should be that guy from how I met your mother
Bernie
Noo Jason Segel who's like Marshall you should be Marshall
oh
Okay I thought you were talking about he's one who got ordained I think
actually
No you did yes also I think about it or you could be um Ted you'd li ke it had
So the compliment or an insult
He does have brown hair so
Okay
and you're not as tall as Marshall
fair yeah
but it's I think a seagull's really creative you have like a yellow beak
oh I thought you were just making fun of my nose
So
No no no
And then you'll need to wear white and have like weird duck feet you can wear duck boots cause it's like duck
I don't have duck boots
oh I'd give you mine but they probably don't fit
Maybe I don't know
I'm sure one of your four friends does
Who knows
um
There's something funny that happened that I was gonna say
Uhm what time is it
it's four ten I don't know how long we've been there should've checked that
Yeah I thought we're getting light refreshments
All I know is that the one thing in the are freshmans
And then there were snacks in the other room also does really good pens to use it like the pen case
do we get some
No I don't know but they're like there's a they are really good pens I got for my birthday a few years ago and they have a store for them in Boston
You got pens for your birthday
No but they're really nice pens they're point five um
like thickness and if they're like high quality many colors
So ten out of ten would recommend
I didn't realize it was possible to get this excited about pens
No I relied particular I pens and my point three eight gel pens
It's kind of weird
No it's not you have you have a weird thing to mechanical pencils
no I don't
I what do you mean I have a weird thing for mechanical
you like mechanical pencils
I prefer mechanical pencils I don't care what kind of mechanical [ ] pencils
oo without that aggressive and things are recording you
Yeah
have you seen Lauren recently or do you not want to talk about that
I think we did homework last night but let's not talk about That
Okay
Um
Um
do you think I can go to the bathroom
no
I should probably wait
Um how many credits do you have now
Umm I did the online one like you said that was really comfortable
That was very uncomfortable
Yeah I didn't like that one at all
Yeah
And then this one'll be that one was like I have a two and a half
And so this will be three and a half
This is seven three now I think
so I'm ahead of you
And then I think I signed up for one more study
I have to wait I I can put you're aead of me in everything right now I need to be I need to win something
oh I also finished the master account last night
oh my okay
just I'll just have to do well onn the test I guess
I've already started studying for the psych exam
I'm like really ahead of the game
Yeah
But I do need to do my essay for me and one class I've email the teacher three times about putting the assignment file like the guidelines cause he said h e had it and he did post it
Yeah
And it's not there and I've emailed him three times
that's very aggressive
the first time he was like om it's there like check and the second time I was like no it's not so he's like um have you tried looking under this seems like it's not there so
That's nice
He's probably just trying to mess with you
I don't think that's the way we have malicious intentions
Yeah I was watching did I tell you how like my ski team in high school'd take like videos of a skiing and like post it for training and stuff
mhm
but I was like watching a bunch of them yesterday and you can hear like I don't know I was getting very nostalgic because you can hear like my friends like making jokes in the background and stuff
oh
Mrs and then there was a couple funny videos of me falling
mhm
found a funny video of one of my friends falling
I've seen videos of you falling
Did I show you the video of my friend Sadie falling
No is Saide the one that
oh it
I've heard her name before she's like your best girlfriend
One of yes she's one of my best friends um
Okay
But she like falls it's the super c super G so she falls like and it looks like a really bad fall
What's the Super G
it goes shlalom ggiant slalom super giant slalom which is super G and then down hill so slalom slalom is like quick turns
sure
giants slalom is like
I thought those were the bumps what are the bumps
No that's not racing
Mott modals mobile mo moo
mo oh my god
moguls
mobile I was so close
But that's not in racing
oh
Racing is just like f just skiing so like slalom is like quick turns
Okay
giant slalom is like
are those slaloms the things with the poles
Yeah where you like hit them
Okay
And then giant slalom
oh you're supposed to hit them
No I mean you don't have to you're allowed to
Okay
But you do normally because if you're hitting them you're closer
mm
so you're s it's quicker
Okay
And then giant slalom is like normal turns
mhm
like if you're just gonna ski for fun
and then super G is like pretty fast that's like fifty sixty
Okay
Miles per hour
And then
No
yeah
that's not po really
That seems really dangerous
Yeah well my first race I was so scared because I was like my f and when when I was a freshman my coaches like kind of like a I mean you look up all American ski racer and he's kind of like
mhm
he's like very intense and like you want to try to impress him
Yeah
So he like when you're expecting he's like yeah this is kind of a tane course I think you'll just be gone like sixty miles an hour and I was like trying to pretend like
oh yeah totally
Yeah so I was like oh cool and inside I was like
And inside I was like oh my god
But anyway my for Sadie like is going really fast and falls and it's like turning upside down and it looks really bad
mhm
and then she stops
Wait was like if they were text tex clicks where she collects no she goes and like a snowball
I think you're thinking of an animated movie
No no you know the car ad it's like an Audi car ad the car is like zipping up the mountain and the snow starts going and it's like misses it every time
like little snowball and it gets bigger every time
That doesn't actually happen in real life
No it did in the ad the ad looked real
yeah in the ad
It does ha it could happen
I'm excited for you actually see winter
I feel like your idea of winter just comes from like Christmas movies at this point
Yeah
I I haven't seen real snow in a while
you're f how you're from is there not snow in DC
I get so warm and then I get slushy and gross
alright I I'm ser like during we're gonna go skiing
oh I don't know about that
We're gonna go skiing
maybe I'll go skating that seems more fun and something I know how to do
If I go skating with you than you'll come skiing with me
I don't even know I go skiing and it sounds so expensive to rent all the things
Not I'll just give you stuff
How you have it with you
Well at my house
oh
I like I'm gonna brings I don't haven't brought anything yet I'll like get stuff that I need during winter break
Where will you put it in your room
Just in the closet I don't know but I have so much it's ridiculous because like

Do you get stuff from tufts work
What do you mean
oh you m like they don't give us anything no
But are they like to those sports jerseys do you like that for skiing
You wear a race suit you will get a bib for that's at each race
Okay

You don't keep that

Except I did get to keep there's some races
You stole it

oh
there's one that the bib that looks like a tuxedo
oh that's pretty cute that clever
Pretty funny that was fum um yes yes I just wanna go skiing right now like really I'm just like very like the for the past like two weeks I've been very antsy
about skiing
No just like
This is fun
This is freaking me out because I feel like I'm looking at like my reflection
We're gonna become rock stars
I feel like in like in the future this freaking me out
wow it's like it looks like it could be a mirror but it's not
I feel like I like it is a mirror like really disturbs I don't think we're either like in the state to handle
Sorry yeah I know I literally have a migraine and I'm and I'm like okay what was I saying before we walked in here
Stats
Stats oh the probabilities can be left in any of them
Okay
Just confirming you should do peace games again please do that
Like everyone in my group was like we're not doing this again so I assume nobody was doing it again
But you can do it
n people are Ashley Wicks are doing it again she's having some of her friends doing it again
But Aviva's still running it
Yes but Emily Reisenberg will be taking over so I think she'll be like doing more
Oh wait she's taking over the whole thing
She will be yeah
I thought it was Reisberg
I have no clue what it is I think Aviva wanted me previously to take over it and I very much made it clear like
I don't know I didn't really want to
Okay maybe I will honestly
Yeah I think you should
We'll see
also one of the alums who I was talking with
For my PJS blog thing who I was like emailing she I like sent her my resume because I'm trying to get her help with other things woah I just got so dizzy um yeah look at the camera um what if this becomes like a viral YouTube video
no
um what if this becomes like a viral YouTube video
No dude I feel like no I feel like I'm like in a movie and like an interrogation scene and like suddenly like I'm gonna about really kidnapped or something
You know those videos where they like get people that broke up and then they put them together and they're like talk about your breakup
Oh  wait
I've actually seen I've seen there's like one where the guy like cheated on a girl
and she's wait did you see that
Yeah
yeah and then they it's
And she's like crying and like he's like now hated for that video

Yeah
but it's
Those are like really interesting though
I like them and then they do somewhere the some of them are cute and they get the people in there like how did you meet
No there's one where there's like a bunch of people and then someone has to guess who were the couples like they're all couples but they have to like put them together and stuff
mm
Okay
Wait why are they d it's just random conversations
Yeah I think it's cause maybe they'll be like w how do people move how do people talk what do they talk about
I feel like I feel like there's like a huge conspiracy and I'm like on a government watch list and they're like
I was just talking about conspiracies on one of the d̲ates about conspi̲racies
wait w
with P

∇I don't know y̲o̲ur thoughts but we'll let them happen∇

no
wai
when did I tell you that
you just like texted me that

yeah good for you that's awesome
thank you
but okay that like totally changed my whole co̲ntext
Yeah I never run into um
Wait is he is he he's a junior right
The hacker anywhere
sophomore we're now juniors
why do I keep I keep thinking he's junior
hm
Okay but I literally must have seen him
Yeah
I'm pretty sure well unless do you know like when he left
no
cause I came late and I'm pretty sure there was a guy who was there at the start who I didn't know who like soon left
So that could've been him oh my god I totally should've like met him and everything
Um that's more fun stories from my week
Wait
I did my laundry on Saturday
on Saturday
haven't
I always do Sunday
Um
wait did I tell yoou about my film noir class
No
I added I didn't tell yoou this I added um this film noir class my brother and like some lacrosse guys are in
that's so fun
So it's like pretentious film noir with the lax bros
mm
umm and I had to watch these two like film noirs over the weekend to like catch up and they're like the most stereotypical like Hey Darlin what are you doing it's um whatever and like they're talking in the most stereotypical voices and like it's just like the detective and like the woman
Are they funny
I actually kind of like at first I was like oh this is boring I don't like it but it's just because like I'm not used to watching that type of movie
I want to watch one with you
You totally should
Yeah
But like once I started like after lke kinda got into it I like now I really like it and it's like so enjoyable to just like watch a movie for homework
Yeah I watch
like I'm just like when I'm burnt out I can just do that
I had to watch a Spanish movie for homework about Che Guevara
It's like communist leader
Who's that
he he became a communist leader in Mexico but it's about the story of him like
mm
What inspired him to do that was he traveled the continent of South America and like saw all the poor Indigenous people um and he became very likes s peace and justicey and socialism and stuff like that and that's what's inspiring me I'm gonna write my twenty five page paper for my war class about Cuba
the fuck twenty five
The third that's ridi
I know
what's the longest you've written
Like seventeen
Okay that's pretty solid I guess it's not that much you just have to do like over time but yeah you should watch these movies with me
oh wow
Actually like okay everyone wants to the people I've told all want to watch Chinatown with me cause that's like some really famous movie
I don't know what that is
um but then there's also like the dark knight it's like a modern one
Really
Okay literally in class today like cause I just want to the class the first time this morning and like my brother and his friend are literally just like on their phones in the back full time and I'm like taking notes like right nice and brother's like laughing at me and um but so he would literally like show us like a single frame of a movie and he would be like look at how like you know there's like the spot of light that was like position during the credit sequence like it changed and like it wouldn't naturally be reflected but it's reflected anyway or something or like so what are your guys thoughts on that what do you think and I'm like
I have no fucking idea
And like
and your brother's like um lacrosse
He wasn't even no he's smart guy he's but he's is in on the you know it's a film class or whatever
In that class not paying attention
Yeah um but like all these people are raising
Is it an art credit
I don't think so
mm
I wish it was all these people are like raising their hands and like oh it's like the difference between like this spectral reality and I'm like how did you get any of that like I don't know but it's I've always wanted to take a film class so
mm
That is cool
I still might drop it cause it's so awk wait did I tell you how awkward and how much social anxiety I had when I was like trying to figure this out cause I like I literally emailed him like the professor and I was like Hey like I just added this class what do I need to do to catch up and also I may drop it like really soon because I'm not sure about like my other commitments yet
mm
and so I like made u all the stuff whatever I came to the class and I like introduced myself to him after class which I was proud of myself for doing causeI never do stuff like that
Yeah
Yeah
I'm like so antisocial I was just gonna leave it but like I should just do this but h I like now it's even more awkward if I drop it because he like totally knows who am
Yeah
why would you drop it
It's my fifth class and like
Oh because it's a fifth class
Depending on my other commitments or whatever and how cause literally the only reason I'm taking it's like for interest it's not like fulfilling anything for me I'm pretty sure it's not an art credit so
oh what else are you taking
all my classes are this is what wait did I tell you about my whole crisis that like maybe I'm stupid
no
Of like all the classes I take or what everyone else considers like easy classes
No but you're in one that linguistics that you're like this is fairly hard
Yeah but like I feel like in general like people consider all the class that I take is like bullshit classes because they're like humanities or whatever
That means nothing
Anyway um
Most engineers might be able to take a humanities class and like most engineers say that a humanities class is actually really hard
Okay
Like they're looking for the easy one
Yeah I mean I don't know
Quote end quote
I feel like some people were in the classroom other like oh this is so whatever but anyway
Yeah I'm in like creative writing a philosophy class called nothingness which is like super out there
Right right
Yeah
right with Darren
Actually me and Darren had so much fun
that dinner was fun yeah
Wait we actually had so much fun in that class after we were literally like um he like did all these drawings in my no cause they were having like technical difficulties with playing like the m videos and stuff so we were just like chilling and so he was like drawing all these weird drawing in my notebook and we were like writing like weird poetry in our notebooks and like writing notes and stuff it's actually really fun
that's fun
um but yeah what was I saying okay yeah nothingness creative writing
Now I'm in this film class stats and this linguistics
they sound that's a lot
I just like suddenly got really insecure about like
in yeah
Because you know last year I was like oh like you know getting to college I was like oh no it's gonna be like hard to do well and I was like oh I'm actually doing well but now I'm re like oh okay I'm doing well but it's in these like classes that people considerable bullshit
mm
and like when I'm actually taking a class like romance linguistics I'm like I have no idea what's goin gon
cause they're hard
Yeah
But I've realized I need to just like study for that class I can't just do the readings I have to like go back and know it
That's annoying
Cause you live through it like you have to know like the tongue like position when you say like ul or whatever and like
Yeah they but I remember we had a a person come in to CBS last year and try teaching that stuff and I was like what
So many like technical
In CBS
Cognitive brain science yeah
uhuh
Stats is actually seemingly okay it just is fine
Everyone said it was gonna be really easy but then someone I talked to said like it's not as easy as everyone says like they said towards the end it gets hard
Yeah it'll probably get harder cause stats does get harder but right now it's like been fine
yeah but a̲l̲so ano̲ther thing was like in that l̲a
I can't
and e̲v̲eryone else had already finished like people finished like two hours before me
Mine lasted two
no mine lasted two and a half hours we couldn't just lea
oh they didn't let you leave
no we didn't get the instructions for anything she was just supposed to be like reading out and teaching us how to do excel graphs and she just like wasn't
wait y̲ou didn't get the instruction sheet
no
what did she even d̲o
walk arou
oh my god
it was s̲uch a hot mess it was
okay but you guys were all doing it like the same pace
yeah cause we didn't have any of the instructions and know what to d̲o
o
For two and a half hours I was there
How did she not have the instructions
I don't know
Wait two and a h how long is it supposed to go
I mean the bl time block is from like nine to eleven thirty
Right
But people said it's supposed to last like n Forty minutes
But people always finish before yeah
I I it can not be that long every time
Yeah it won't be but okay yeah that's just like a bad TA but what happened was like cause I've never had exce like I've never used excel before and so people finished so like two I'm not kidding like two hours before like like an hour before me and like me and Abby were like what the f like how
oh you're in the same one
Yeah like we were sitting next to each other there and I was so lost
That's fun
and I like felt so inferior cause like my friend who's taken it before like oh those lab like
they take like thirty minutes
I know
and I'm like for you like it's going to take me the whole time
Where are our refreshments
We missed it's okay I just like pounded peanut butter so
I want to take a nap before stats
You have class
You totally have time
Yeah
I do not I have fifteen minutes between romance and stats
And then I have to decide what to do again for dinner tonight cause I have that weird awkward time before my six thirty I did Hodge last week but it's
I would just always get Hodge
It's not good I don't know why people thi
Well what do you get
Last week I got like the pasta and by the time I walked uphill it was cold

They like can make you pasta
O
Well have you tried like all the different things you don't like any of them
It's just a lot of it I can't eat anyway
Can you eat the Mediterranean
Not really
Wait why
just like the sodium and stuff it's like
Well I mean you are right near Dewick to get like a quick dinner but
I don't know I'm wish I had my ph do I have my phone
can I use my phone
Then you can like make a PB and J or something
can I just like look at the menu
This is social psych we always wanna like damn I want to be charging my phone right now they have a plug too but I don't have a charger
Oops
But tonight um I was gonna like get Hodge and like do work and drink tea with My friend Madeline
Oo
but I like have so much work and I'm so tired that I'm like maybe I should pushit to a different night
mm
I get that I feel that what are they they have weird things at Dewick why do they have weird things all the time now
oh but they do have the chocolate cream pie but that I have a headache I can't eat the pie I just wa mm
How do you kno like you have to keep track of I wouldn't n like I would totally lose track of like what has sodium or whatever
I don't even know at this point I just  know what I can't eat
You just figured it out
Like and for example like I wanna eat broccoli but it the broccoli is broccolli with garlic and oil and I can't eat garlic
oh
boo
Wait are you still in a the state of stress and chaos
no
cause remember we were like texting we were both like oh my god like
well cause it was ex boy was here on Saturday and it was putting me in
But you didn't have any interaction or anything
no I Didn't go to the track meet
But like you just felt
I just felt it
How are you what were you
we didn't really talk no yeah but we didn't really talk
did I tell you that
Yeah I just got well a it was all this stuff about the like classes and figuring out my schedule or whatever and like also summer stuffand emailing and bullshit which I'm like totally not dealing with and then also I had a call back which was like what was really freaking me out that day and like making me really anxious
Right
and then you added a class
But then after that I just like felt a lot better that was over cause I get so anxious for that stuff and like I honestly don't think I did really well but I'm trying to just not deal with it or think about it until I find out cause I know it's gonna crush me but I don't wanna think about it yet
those things are so se scary
Yeah m
I don't like rejection
I know wait dude did I tell you how anxious I got about sending that message last night I was literally sitting with Laylee Having dinner
Sending what message to the teacher
the birthday thing
Oh really
And I was like oh my god like fear of rejection like everyone's going to have stuff like everyone's gonna say no and drop out
I know I'm so s you should make like a doodle
and there's gonna be like three people
And then there's gonna be like three people left and they're gonna be like oh I don't know if I wanna come cause like everyone else dropped out
no some people totally can come I'd and I just didn't write because I s saw it immediately I wasn't gonna like be like no I can't as the first thing
Yea
you know what I mean
that's fair yeah yeah yeah
Um
But
but yeah
let's see
Lailee can come Bell ugh Bell she's so cool Bell can come
Wait did I tell you I got high with though
No but you went to her house right
Wait should I not ho
Yeah we like
Illegal substances
We like
I just got really like
I think it's decriminalized in the state of Massachusetts
okay let's tell I'm uncomfortable
um but oh my god it was so funny because her roommate like one of her housemates was hosting the tuf tufts dems trivia night like tufts Democrats
woah
At their house and they literally we were like out there like with the whatever
Who's her roommate
Just some girl I don't know
Okay
um Out we were out there and they all walked in and we were like oh my god and we just went to the room and then like we would periodically like hear them and it was just like insane Like it like they were so nerdy Like it they were having like it was ridiculous like they're like well in nineteen fifty three like not to not to be a asshole but like we were just like apo we were just like staring
No I love it
mm
like what is happening
hm
And we were like playing each other music videos and stuff it was funny
That's so funny where does she live
She did I tell you I actually want her house senior year she lives right at the bottom of the rainbow steps
mm nice
which is like a great location and I told her like I have my eye on it
That's good
Do you think you're gonna
Fish I'll be here next year
Yeah she's
And then right
right yeah wha are you t̲hinking of l̲ike are you g̲onna s̲tay in that same h̲ouse for s̲enior year
we'll s̲ee h̲ow I'm feeling I mean like I think everyone thinks I am
oh really
but
it would be you
Caroline Camille
Caroline
Camille
Camill↓e
yeah she w̲i̲l̲l̲ be in it next spring
in place of who
u
the new girl
in pla in place of both you and me
like y̲ou and me won't be there in the spring
but the will the new girl
Kristin would still be there and Ca
Okay but then
but there's four rooms
right but then who would be the four
okay so it'd be you
mm oh I don't t I don't know I don't think so
okay but Camille's moving in in place of u
and you
well no̲
bo
c
yeah you're right
but who's Kristin
so then
I thought Kristen was replacing me
Kristen's w̲i̲th us
I know̲
okay well e̲ither way like she's gonna take the spot left by you
I know
so how are y̲o̲u gonna live there wi̲th her I guess if Laura goes if Laura leaves right
I I don't think Kristen's there my senior year
We sho
she's she's not on
mhm so she'll probably won't be there either
But that's theoretically I would get it in senior year to
Do you wanna do not
I if I'll have to live in it see how I feel if it's a nice place I'm sure I'll be fine
mhm
I won't really want to have to move again if I don't have to make my parents do it um Avalos stuff
Thing was like well this is just compared to Bella's house but like I felt like Bella's house felt a lot more like open and that was like a little felt a little like tight
Yeah no I I agree
And it was also like in it's also much better location
Although I do it for me for me it's in a good location like for my life
for Ginn
yeah for Ginn and then just like in middle life
Yeah well I mean her house is closer to Ginn probably
Just like flat
But
We'll see I also wouldn't want to have to deal with it all again but
I don't know
I know it was the one of those things though again like I was lucky I didn't have to go through the process
Of
I was lucky
yeah although it was the nervous because and I did have to just like say yes the first thing that was there without any alternatives but a lot of people didn't necessarily have that like they were then like scrambling to find something like I have my my friend Sarah vegan Sarah was just like just that they just found a place and it's more expensive than ours

Yeah I don't know what the problem is um Getting comfortable
Sometimes you're like that freaks me out cause then like if your battery just starts like dying unpredictably all of a sudden like kind of I told you like that moment we're my phone was glitching out I realized how dependent I am on my phone
Do you have a six S
Five S

The S they like are replacing the batteries for free I wonder if they're doing it with the S too cause they're like purposely like slowing the batteries
They're such assholes fucking obsolete what is it called planned obsolescence
Woah what
we learned that that's where like they plan for the old iPhones to be obsolete so that you have to get thenew iPho like
mm

The there was like eleven at like that house a put on um so I was about that so and um those like dancing and I don't really know how somebody like it hit me from behind my knee so what I found out afterwards is that my need is located
oh
and it tore ligaments and  also like knocked off a piece of cartilage
Oh wow
So the surgery was to like move piece of cartilage and um like they tighten up to like a man so
dang
I was
Did you know like immediately that like Ginny was like dislocated
n no no no because I guess it kind of popped back in m aybe I'm not really I'm not exactly sure how like what happened but um ye ah I think I think that's what happened and like I kind of so like a buckled I fell down
Yeah
Um
and then like some people help me up and like the ones I mi ss had doubt it they like trying to get ice and stuff um when I stoo d that night and then the next morning I woke up and it was like very swoll en like like I kind of knew that night that I was gonna I was gonna have to go to like health services the next
Yeah
The next day but I just kind of like yeah I was like okay it's fine um and just carried on and so then exam health services um and then they look at it and they like been wrapped up in like one of t he psych bandage things and like a car to so it was like trying to put weight on it keep elevated surprising it
Yeah
But then they were up like actually you know what it's like it's very schoo l and so um I think that maybe you should go to the ER so I went to or somewhere else
Yeah
um
I went to the urgent care they like the genetics and stuff with that nothing's broken because like OK cool so like it's pro like sprayin g to like I'll I'll go better like a week or two um they're like ye ah keep icing a keep elevated yeah use crutches you know just you know just give us feels like I went back um I gave up on the crutch es within within twenty four hours because it was just a pain
it was just easier to live but then to actually use the crutches
m
Uhm
And then I have like a follow up appointment with an orthopedic doctor and like he examined my knee and stuff and was like okay so the good news is y ou have a minus brain on MCL which is kind of a like mind but u hm the bad news it's up like after he said that I was like okay yeah cool so lik e how mine is pretty tough that's cool and like the way he said it was n't like there's good news and that's bad it was just like oh yeah it's goo d many goes oh um and the bad news is that um I think you may have t orn torn your AC out and I was like oh okay and like I k ind of knew that that was bad I think I've heard of people tearin g their ACL like it's it's pretty bad right
Yeah
that sounds right
Then like he's like oh do you want me to like speak to your parents or som ething so like it's but and I was like yeah I might be helpful so I could c all my mom um he talked to her for a bit like explain the situation to her um yeah that I had an MRI and they found out that it wa sn't actually a sale that was torn it was just like Michael the MPO file  which is which is a different argument but it's slightly better because um
A sale is like dangerous if you tear like the rehab was very long but
Yeah
Yeah if I was an ice pack
So how much longer till
So I learned how the brace for like ten days now like I had the surge ry on the twenty second um
Next Thursday I can start bending my like in the race and then I have it f or like two more weeks and then I should be
mhm
dang
He like there might be so much I would happen this summer to me beca use I mean I didn't break or not fake it at like hear anything but I was
I was a truck driver back in high school
hm
I would have been the track and s tuff like that so like the like this past really really did too much after looks after the first semester so it's like well on
Well you have to like um like can't get back in fitness and stuff like that so
mhm
I was here the summer and then I was like yeah like this could be my summer I'm gonna go like running every day to the gym and stuff like that like could be perfect and then once I can't break I went back home was there for like a week and then it came back here to like sta rt um that's a pretty soon like a few days before like the start looked for some session and then um psych I went running in the like I was a feeling good so like I like running a lot further than I probab ly should have
uhuh
And then like I came back to make everything was fine every like I think like a mouse a told or something that's like most times as like he's like five or something odd and then everything was fine because like stretching but the n after does gonna walked fully with my friend and then like unlike s tart on the walk there's like hot like that's funny like my right foot kinda hea ds there's like no it's like finding we can to keep walking but then like by the time like we got like like really close to fully I was like limping like really badly and I I couldn't put any pressure my right foot to the point like
Oh
Read it will be back
mhm
to campus and then the next morning I was like yeah like know that I can't believe any pressure like on this but at all  um and it was like a tie fighters just like one side of it kind of
mhm
so then he like I could even like walk to health services f rom like
Oh
Hell yeah I had to YouTube red for health services
Yeah
um
Which isn't as because like I had like started working so big zero money in my account
uhuh
it's like that was like please last my money to get to health services
um
Yeah and like that's like when they checked it out and everything and they were like oh yeah you should probably put some  um and then I went there that was like  a long wait because it wasn't ER it was
um
urgent c yeah exactly yeah
Urgent care Yeah yeah I went to urgent care too
um
so like that was like a whole process and like they said like nothing seems wrong like anand like and then they checked if it was like a fracture or anything like A good breaking yeah
Did they do an xray and stuff
u
there's like oh like the n say keep elevated like ice and stuff like that like and how to do that f or a week for forty go back health services for that week I didn't do anyt hing mechanical where can like it was pouring because like I ha d to do with all I did was like lay in bed and just like sleep for a long time i n the wake up and can do anything again and like
Yeah
Felt so needed to because like my roommate like head start working either as like I have for like order food
He'd have to go to get it for me because I can like walk all the way down yeah in the end like what it was like the didn't figure out what it w as either I'm
They thought it was a was it
Like the health services doctor thought that it was like tendonitis or something
oh
like along the right side of my foot um  but then when I started doing um what's it called
not
um
Not therapy it's like
Physical ther Physical therapy
Yeah physical therapy yeah yeah
And when I had to start doing like PT like that's when like the guy was like yeah he's like I'm pretty sure like you had like a stress fracture or like something like that
Oh
Yeah it's like that was I did that for like basically like the rest of the summer and like couldn't go running at all and like
oh
do anything that like I wanted to do
Which sodium and then I had like been running at all for a whil e the first time actually ran was the day before thanksgiving
oh wow
and like
I feel okay
Is it fine now
I think yeah it's definitely got a better look over like the past few months I think like at the beginning of school like I can like public if I stood on it for like normal stance for too long to like like puts like the too much pressure like that it was like stepping like
Not hurting but just like uncomfortable and so that's when it at but Schif rin pressurelike I think like now it's like almost normalize to like the point were like I think it if I had like Stanford along how club I'm in the choirs like sometimes were like skinny too long like that's when the guilt feel like little bit discomfort but yeah I think everything's like better
mhm
but I think it's like like getting injured I think during the school year it's just so much wears
yeah h
I heard a story about a guy who's on the football team I think and then at the homecoming game he got hu rt
Oh
And then he broke his leg or something happened but then h ere take like a semester off because like the school is in like handicap a ccessible look at all really
Yeah
Because like every take all hill
Yeah
And like those few places that have like ramps for the glitches and stuff like that
Right yeah
F
Yeah I mean I kind of though okay because the timing of the surgery was meant that like I had the thanksgiving days off
Yeah
and then and weekend
um
and then I took Monday off and then like I want to I came for clas ses on Tuesday um but I moved back to campus on Wednesday because I was s taying at a friend's apartment like I my parents came
mm
mm
to like help with everything
But like F if I had to have the surgery like a different time I would like I would have to miss when will cost spend harder
like if it's good because
Yeah
Like the surgery that I got out means I can still kind of like walk just it takes longer
Yeah
But like there was an option for different surgery wher e they would of reattached the piece of cartilage that fell off
oo
um
and like and they were like the place my like I'm instead of just typ ing it up
And so that would have been like a more major surgery like I woul d've been in more pain so in the in like that case I would miss like so much more school I would like been bedridden probably
yeah
And like so close to finals especially that we have just and such a nightmare
And like not being yeah
Yeah
tuh
Yeah I remember like I said like day after I like with like the hosp ital like my friends coming um um um the call it deal like t he calling festival
no
but there's like a best for like close by um I think this city over the summer and um
It's called like I don't have tickets well like I would have bought them but then like cuts didn't have any money
um
So then but I think problems in like about at the the that they go s ee them at least there's like twenty that equality be November and s ay no that Kaylee Calif tried me status
and ended
Which through an is
There's almost
How how far can you get them to drive you
um
I think it's gonna be a terrorist like you have like &laughs speci fic any entries in like
I'm not exactly sure like how far I know definitely take this back to campus
I think so yeah
Did you get an try around campus to
No that was like the only time I really you some like other than other tha n that was like during that we could really to six stayed in the dorm
yeah
um
After that after that knows I really just like be going practice like kind of ground
Like yeah because after that week of using crutches which sucked I hated using crutches
yeah that's no fun
yeah
um
like finish the collecs set up it was l ike
What walking around which I probably should have been a traditional like that I could just like made it clear to like longer but
mhm
and I probably would have gone like that a senior but
What happened
Yeah I was a star to get the hang of it too
mhm
Using crutches like on stairs
Yeah
it's not
I like when I like the day after I heard it when they give me her just the y're like don't put any pressure on that like so like that was hard code wh ich you like using probably after the surgery they were like you can put w eight on the leg seen just need to like it's great for support so was n't like hopping on them which is better
I like when I like the day after I heard it when they give me her just the y're like don't put any pressure on that like so like that was hard code wh ich you like using probably after the surgery they were like you can put w eight on the leg seen just need to like it's great for support so was n't like hopping on them which is better but they're still that Japan like I gave up on them like
Yeah
On Wednesday
Yeah and there's like I keep like reminding myself of it because like  it's so weird and like I like imagine how it's for other people who like have to like use the crew can't like user like for an extended p eriod of time because like in that I think in that one week it's like
Yeah
You know it's like when you like normally walking like you kinda like it do you think the calf extension select and like
Yeah
Yeah so like because like I was putting the comic pressure like
mhm
the left calf muscles like bigger now like I have right one
And I said hot
Yeah I can noticed like this like just like Sergey getting smaller lik e
Yes
Of like the cough especially like what when I when the base comes off and I can finally walk normally it's going to be so like and even
Yeah
Gonna have to like do you like wait just some slack
I'm
That's what like yeah we now I'm like when I'm walking up with more stuff and st uff like that like I like making a conscious effort to like one of l ike stepping up I'm like using like very like
Right right
To like start like
Yeah building up yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah because of nothing like I've been doing stay as one of the time for like mo re than a month acids I got injured I haven't been working stiff normally in before the surgery so like I've always been putting more pre ssure my left and going up for like yeah
Which like right now like when it it to classes like do you leave early fr om a different class daily permission to do that or do ask
um
I don't actually need to because so the way I have classes I have I have are making um in before psych
Okay
um
and so is right next to it so
Yeah
I can make it that's fine um and then so I have aller gies a there's a and there's only classes I have cheese if there's a
Okay
And then Monday Wednesday I have something in page whole  and then something break are right after
Okay
okay
And that's also really close so I didn't have an issue making i t to the
Are you a third done
I'm up the hill and well I mean health and if you pull it up him
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah oh then that's a pretty community
Yeah
Because like everything just like right up there like many of ho

Yes like you wanted to like go to more steps we like to any of that if you don't have to
Yeah
yeah
Bio he

mm
um
The called wait what floor hill
uh
For
Okay I was on fourth over the summer
oh
yeah it was like was it fourth was mainly people who were like staying over the summer session third was um
What was third was it blast or best I think third was oh fourth was also like some blastees
Third and second were blast and best
What was that
It's
um
They're for I think
They're more for like low income like high school students like to make transition like into college easier
so like they can take like classes and like also have like a mentoring kind of thing
oh
Okay
I'm so blessed for like liberal arts students and bases for like and use s o the conflict over the summer take the getting to classes something
mhm
for th e summer second a recession yeah it was great being here for him lik e on campus of the summer
So what are you here to do
I was doing an internship at the office of health promotion and prevention
Okay
It's like
um
It's in the that the basement like it's like downstairs in health services
Okay
Yeah it's a pretty close to the characters after it's a great questi on yeah
Yeah it was cool yes is a pretty like low key to because I'm ha d a going I did like a lot of work really work remotely
mhm
so like on the medical and like once I should two times two times a week one day li ke full day and then the other day like half day
This is a pretty good seven
mm
How long was it
It was so
The entire thing was um
The come back I came back like late may public last week I think and then I stayed till the first week of August I think yeah
Sixty
Does like my Tyson was area
yeah
It is really nice especially beginning this summer because like there's no one on campus
Yeah
Like at all
Yeah
And like you feel like you have like all to yourself like you do
Yeah it's a nice because I didn't go um like in the inning
Oh okay
I was so nice it because out we were here and then there was like fit and some of the other pre goes but like I was like maybe a quarter of the freshman year and that was it and like no other class and it was so nice like I've campus is always like that
Like dining halls were empty and like also summer so it's just really nice like campus is really beautiful and it was like not crowd and you co uld go to truth and you wouldn't find maybe other people there
Yeah that's that's how was like all the time and then started a like a lot more he became there's like a lot of different programs going on to
mhm
like south becomes like a hotel kind of thing
ooh
Were like for like I think south is really there's like a Chinese ex change program think
Okay
Restaurants internally come and then I think some people get paid to like be kinda dementors actually run the Boston that also like be learn English to
So like they all get like air conditioners and it's it's really funny when you're like passing by and then carm become something else and then people there's like some people staying in Wren which is weird because like yeah you start seeing a lot more people and then you're like what's going  but yeah  wait are you a first year
Yeah
Okay so you did GO
Yeah
How was it
It was really fun yeah um yyou basically like like it's not stressful at all you don't like there's no agenda really like there's just fun activities it has a very summer camp feeling to it
mhm
um
like they took us um to Harvard Square one day um one day we went to rock port beach um one day we went to like Quincy Market and yeah like and they also have like phone and banking sessions and stuff like on campus because it's meant for like international kids who don't have all that set up yet um yeah so yeah it was really fun and like
A suite like gotta some of the sophomores and
like most of the of go advises us off once a few juniors
Yeah
yeah
I'm sorry for me who was a co hosted I'd
um
I'd Quincy um and my other guy was trying to but he's a junior
um
and my other guy was trying to but he's a junior
Okay I don't know that many people and go I have a lot of frie nds who did go
mhm
then this of them tried to be like posted visors and like b ecome involved with it
Yeah
I'm involved with focus
Okay
Yeah I did focus last year then a support staff this past summer and now I'm more the court it is
Oh cool
Yeah
So are you like spend a summer planning about for
mhm
To me into the people um
Yeah are like jobs take me through the texts Mister
so
um
retired like the entire staff for focus
nice
which includes a part s of Michael's like leaders um and then that doing that um doing like some meetings with like everyone just like at the mall like me each other and then also like getting them upset because it is a few chan ges won't focus
mm
and then Joe but it is
Oh yeah
Just like all the Prius like after the debate is
mhm
then those are the biggest things and then I think we go back conflict two weeks or three weeks and then we come back and then we show the entire summer like working for like an campus center from ninety four
It'll be fun like I think both of my chords they're both amazing people and like I I know one a lot better than the othe r one but like I know that
mhm
yeah the budget like anything
What is your focus
So the way folks is like structured as um it's national coast at the same time as focused as
Yeah I think so
It's go focus and two start together and then fit cafe and squad  start afterwards like I I think a day or two afterwards
Oh no I think it was the other way around
Oh was it
'Cause I remember for us go started on the twenty sixth and so three of them started on the twenty sixth and three started on the twenty fourth
Oh right 'cause it's
um
okay no it's cafe cafe
Ggo and fit gogo and fit started on the same time cafe started earlier
Yeah cafe starts with two and focus and then go starts with fit a nd squad
Okay yeah
Okay yeah
I know the the cafe ago yeah so I'm it's ca lled
I think the change like a little bit now but like how it was like the pass is that on it's like you know like when you I sentenced with different her oes and stuff like that have a description so if you center for focusing except into focus um and then there's gonna be like a sec ond him at the comes out and like it really just be I think just informati on about yourself and then there's also um a bunch different except categories of service we want to do because folks his surroundings community service
mhm
on to this like arts advocacy children's advocacy like environmental homel essness um to be to Cuba to see um
Does
It is it a bunch of other stuff like that too on each year the psych wards I can you want added on to and then once you like you choose like I think five your top five or something
and then
mhm
um
I'm a member this for l ike when I was first you like I have like looked into this again um and then you like she's like you rank the ones that you want and then you just a kind of wish that
Okay
And then like later on like towards the end the summer like we're like I think mid July or something um the court date and like sent you a gain like an email that has like your placement um and then l ike it also has a courses in a group and then the leaders to
mm
It's like the way the fifties instruction in the past is that um everyone sits in churches
Sometimes like people it literally sleeping churches but then other times is like buildings that are like calc attached to a church that like
Okay
The like sleeping like some of the concerns on
Yeah and then um for it's like the difference of categories is like t here's not just one group from missus is like comes this one who misses two home s history
mhm
Yeah and then um for it's like the difference of categories is like t here's not just one group from missus is like comes this one who misses two home s history um but they all turn to tell like are in the same church
Yeah what else can I say I just like it's really fun because l ike than like what we kinda stop using them in language I don't know if like you ever use like go brother's something
Uhm
not really
I don't think thirty because like
Yeah I think it's more of a good thing for I think two I think for fit and focus because like when you're in like a small group but if you only like if you the people than like in the past thank you kindly what's it like you were like a family and then he be like oh this is like my fo brother  thank my first Esther and stuff like that
uhuh
Oh yeah we we used to like joke about like might conceive was my advise always like joke about her being a go mom but like
she like really hated that because
Yeah yeah
She's like realy young from software like I'm kind of old for the or so she's only like her birthday was during go
mm
um and she trying nineteen and like so you're basically a month older than me so she was lik e it's so weird for you to call me ago on like that
Sounds old but like I'm really not
Yeah  we like it used to be like than past I know PB Sears like it was like an issue last year
Like when I was like a freshman um
Like the leaders gave us the option is iconic opt you're like often route it was like the like the like all it is what we did in the past like we he 's a family language
mhm
like if you think think think you're comfortable w ith it like we can totally is if not like if there's like one person was uncomfo rtable with it like the neck we won't use it off like Texas anonymous and everything thank every decided that we were fine with it um  but then this really becomes the complete like it did make an option which i s like no other feelings at all and it's really just because like tha t's really the exclusionary to like other freshman because like when you coming in like you're in the call the things about your fo family to fan and stuff like that
mhm
and then um there's some people who like
Didn't wanted you prefer than this other people like training like couldn't affo rd to do prio
mhm
and like make some feel cadet like out of it like I think that the first few weeks and like I know that a lot of people told me t hat and it's also like really don't know like some people family situ ation so like
mhm
effectively don't have like I said like the parent or guardian or something so
Yeah sure
Is that where those things yeah so then I'm also with folks it's like
With like
It's check kindly forms like upon and stuff like that and then
Most of the days like you doing like one or two like service sites o n and the support staff is really like there like help like everyone a little psych the courts with definitely need but then also like to like drive them to difference as because now everything's in like Medford or Somerville a Boston like some of it's like I was like an hour away
mhm
so there's like sports stuff is like intro to psych driving in t he picking up sites and then like one of the places um but like eve ry group also has an off day and on the off to like they can do like whate ver they want and like they have to get like amount of money like they can spend to like the one he's a good go to a restaurant like went to Boston link  could convince
Yeah I really
Yeah
Like so in touch with your
Okay yeah
Yeah
Yeah well but pretty close I think some of us like I think we all the Jenny like each other that just like some of them became close than other ones I know like how many three of them are like i n the same sweet to there in high school
To them and like the other another suite Haskell
Anya
But we're also a pretty close and it feels like stock messaging like your chat
mhm
yeah
But I think it's just like yeah
It's interesting for like some leaders I know who like go and like expect to like I have like a really like tight knit group and stuff like it hasn' t always like like out like that just because like
Yeah
Yeah it's like something like I'm like
Have to consider when I'm like when I hire the staff and the like assigning a good appears because and it's like after like some like I know t hat a lot of leaders but then I also like don't know some of them
thank I'm like never so like I'm like matter to people who like a sailing are compatible or like
Yeah
That which the because like a weird like dynamic
Yeah
For their group
Because I like when on the first day of go and I was like really aw kward and everybody was like doing introductions and stuff
Uhm like
The advisors I kept on saying like oh yeah like I really like make someone friends during go and like it's quite often like you like the first person like the meet and like who's in your go group and like end up being best friend s with them or whatever it and like your friends for all four years wha tever and
Like I kind of just to me it sounded like I am a this is the
All say that doesn't actually happen kind of thing I like in my go roup I'm like I wasn't that close with like everyone in the group bu t like um like to people in the group I had connections with anyway s because basically there was one girl who um was kind of a family friend like because um our dad used to work together
Oh
Uhm in New Jersey
mm
and like so I knew that she was going at tufts and like the message but like we haven't really met like ap parently we have like knew each other when we were really little but lik e not of us remembered
Oh
And then if you just happen to be my go groups that was like really funny c oincidence um and then another guy was he went to school with my room mate so like um I kind of knew him through her um so like I lo ved being better friends with them because they already have those connection s
Yeah
Uhm and like all of my white friends like right now we all did go an d like we all are kind of friends because medic over but not because you in the same go group
Yeah
So yeah
like
And it's like something like a for to his it's like go like peop le who like to go like death and like are the friends of the ea ch other because it's like you have your go groups like the not to like se t in stone because like I think don't you like all go together to like do
Yeah yeah we like oh
The activities
Yeah
Yeah and it's not like as big as like to our focus like you actually get t o like me other people and like
mhm
are like just yeah
Yeah
And that's like something that I thought that it was that was a r eally cool I remember like
Like what you say make it like oh like these are the people that like you can be best friends with and stuff like that like
I remember like on the first night a focus
They're like my leaders like sharing though he experiences and stuff like that a nd then I figure if it if is the first major like the first morning or something like that first I'd like second it simply up like um
They're really talking about like how like close like for fans get and stuff lik e that and it's like
mhm
a Megan's like you guys like like during the can was extra of awkward but like you guys are the be like obsessed and like in love with each other like family and the focus and like we are like th is like the second day were like in like the scene nice people like every
So could put a
Hey
This is so cool hello
If okay read the questions did you bring your phone
I did I feel like we can
Okay um what we talk about
I can remember them
The questions
Okay
So we do that early to something else
we can do that or not
um cool
Wait what were they there's one that was good I like the
Uhm the your life story
um
that one
mm
Okay
Uhm
we could do the um
Do you do you want to be famous and if so what for
Yeah yeah yeah what the okay
and why
okay um during the first
you can go
alright
I don't know I've definitely thought about this a lot
mhm
I feel like I don't know I don't necessarily want to be famous
Right
I just kind of wanna be like
Successful
Yeah
like or like
Do something out like that I like but like I don't need to be famous I guess
mhm
Yes I wanna be like I don't know yeah I don't know
Not necessarily
Yeah I think when we think of famous people we think of like
credit card
Idols but also there's like other famous people who aren't like media stars you know
Yeah no you're right yeah
Unlike their different worlds I think like
Yeah
It would be cool to be like known
Yeah
Like to do something you love and like
Yeah
Get recognition for it
Yeah yeah yeah
But also like that comes with like higher expectations and link with things like that
mm
Yeah
But also like they'd be fun to be a pop star
No yeah
Maybe
Right
But who knows if that's fun
No like that would honestly be fun
I could be down
Yeah or like like I feel like Broadway will be fun
Yeah it's like less known
Yeah
But also known
Yeah and it's like yeah
You get to like go out in public
I don't know
Yeah but like you're not like being chased by paparazzi probably
Right
you know what I mean
smart
So I guess that we made
Me too
Well
okay
Uhm the first one was
The
the first one was um
Uhm um
The um lunch with a person
yeah
mm
then
Any of them
I guess we can just talk

like we walked in the room in like spiders scuttled away like we really
salt we
It was like
it was like that
oh
um there's so many stories fr om this place there were bullet ants like
Are there a lot of Bucks
the bugs are a lot
Yeah
Not as much as Australia
Yeah
Austria is like
The things aid repost
You know I know

But the ants are like you can see I keep thinking you can see Our lady a big end like they look like full bugs not like a You know
Yeah
yeah
but there's many of them because that's what and stew
Yeah
yeah
yeah
So it's kind of shocking
Yeah
So those were in a room but we got him out
weird
Yeah
There's like spiders
Yeah
And this hotel particularly had like an infestation of the giant orb weavers
uh huh
you know the ones that are like they have the white heads and like the black in the Yellow
Yes yeah
oo      stop
Uhm yeah
I hate spiders so that was definitely a lot for me
same
Yeah
And it was right by the beach and at night all the crabs come out
saw
which I think will be like cool
So we see little hermit crabs until my doors open and standing with like th e other guy who share in the room with me
Yeah
End of the largest crab I have ever seen it was like this big
oh
Like when you order crab at a restaurant
Yeah yeah
the size of the crab was &l aughs the size of this crab
yeah
wow
On land
that's so creepy
with painters
That was making a beeline for our open door and We started just yelling
So far
because if it's so big and comfy
oh my gosh
So fast that we had it Kay we had to
stop Noah
it closed the door
stop
It was coming in our room
had to kick it
stop
also in that very hotel the hotel manager had a dog
And you think
Love that
I own a hotel
I am the manager my dog is caught and
yeah
Rate
Not
So
I imagine people beheading the dog
Yeah
I love dogs head I go over
Yeah
did it snarl
I pet the dog and it bites me
noah
and it um like ripped my pinky and I was bleeding this whole much it Hurt so bad and I still have this car and you can't really see it but you told You can you can you can see
Wait can you think
can you can you see
The white
Whatever there's a scar but then it was like I had to go to the clinic and was on these terrible antibiotics that like rack to me
yeah
Yeah
And
d w what
I was in a foreign country I was like try to speak Spanish
It was a mess
Monaco dad um
Pero motto
deado
um and then the clinic was like okay do you have does the owner have the re cords for the dogs meaning like where his vaccinations so like
Yeah
oh no
You don't have
Babies
rabies
so and we talked and he's like um I don't have records but like he has had his vaccinations for like
yeah
Yeah
Yeah
That could be B S
yeah
you know
so we go back to the clinic really he doesn't have records
Yeah
they're like well If a dog has rabies it'll die like a few weeks after
And rabies can show up anytime up to nine weeks
Yeah
And If you don't get vaccinated for rabies and you cut it you almost certainly die
oh my
So I'm like I'll just get the shot how much is it she's like it was something crazy like twelve thousand dollars
noah
And I didn't get it
noah
But a free every week I would call and be like someone as ked us to better um you know
um um
And I don't have rabies
That was scary
Long story
because I don't think you have rabies like also like wasn't deep enou gh that like you should be worried
Yeah
And you're like crazy drugs and you flushed out
Yeah
yeah
But see you there what when the clinic was telling me that a woman
can't believe it bit you
A woman was in there earlier the monkeys you know like the capuchin monkeys
yeah yeah yeah yeah
the like you know

Yeah
and then
And this is like
This is more the
way more Intense
More legit
Yeah

and this is mirror right or something or like a really big window
uh I don't I don't know

I think it's a two way mirror

Um I'm thinking about cognitive brain sciences
cognitive brain sciences

zero hobbies
yeah
do you play video games
hm

Watch any TV shows
um I'm tryna start s Stranger Things this weekend
oh yeah I've heard that's big
The second season
I haven't seen it either but my friend says it's really good
it's really the first season was like amazing
Thank you really have no hobbies You were just like getting around I couldn't tell
uh
you have to have something right
like everyone has something
I'm like a pretty boring person I I like um I play squash
Squash is something
yeah
yeah
I'm not on a team but like I play casually but I played in high school um yeah
I watch YouTube videos
It wait squash is like just a paddle and a black rubber ball so it is
Um it's like racquetball except like the ball is smaller it's like tennis inside like inside a room
What made you get into the red um squash
um My parents just signed me up for it when I was a kid you know like it's really fun I think it's a lot more from than like
Thank tennis
Tennis cause tennis you have to like walk around and pick up the ball every time
I sure you the run a lot as well
yeah
I mean squash is like a lot of short movements it's like
You hit like the room isn't that big so you can run from corner to corner
Yeah
How do you like what's like I I'm not familiar with like the how it works like the the matches and like the scoring or like points
it It's it's like ping pong score right it's goes to eleven win by two um imagine it's like tennis except like you hit it against the wall
Wait wait how do you get like score a point against your opponent cause you're both in the same room right
If it bounces twice
So bounces twice okay
Yeah so like imagine you're like playing tennis except like both sides of the cout are like mirrored on one side
Mmmmm
So like you hit the ball against the wall like imagine that's like going across the court and then it bounces off and then your opponent has to hit it back onto the wall
When you hit it though you have to like step aside for your opponent to c
Well yeah there's like enough room you do you don't want to hit it to yourself otherwise you'll get like point off
Aye
Do you that means you can also can you guys like add spins to your shots or like
Yeah
Okay
I mean and you can hit it off the side walls and the back wall
and like there's like ba lines to make sure which which parts the wall are out
Oh okay that makes sense seven played okay
Yeah
Sounds like fun
And this one
And played do we have a squash court here
We have like three they're really they're really bad I don't know if I can curse
We where are they
They're like they're on the top floor of the Jim Jackson gym
Oh okay
they Need like they're so bad that the squash team doesn't even practice there they go to Harvard
That's so sad
I know it's pretty sad
my squash team is is good that's why I'm not on the team I couldn't
Are they good
Yeah
How do you like on
I mean they're not like good I mean they're good like in comparison to other schools but like in NESCAC is like the best um
Like division for squa
Wait is it
This is are squashed D three words some there do you own or something
Um I'm not sure
Fair
I don't know
I mean I'm not on the team
Fair enough
It's reasonable
Ready for the psych stats test next week
oh yeah you wanna like teach me because I don't
No I I am actually miss like two lectures
I haven't been paying attention for weeks like I haven't paid attention to it since the last exam
I miss to lectures did only dying
uh I have to like I think I have to read I'm gonna read the entire like hundred pages in the textbook this weekend
Was it more help for the read a textbook or just
The textbook is like really helpful for me I mean I haven't like the the the little bit of red is like very helpful case I thoguht the first exam is pretty easy and then like this one I don't know any of the contents so I have to learn it
Like I wasn't alas is busy everything on the slides
Yeah but the last one was like
In a sense
I mean the slides I don't think are very hopeful I don't find them helpful
Okay fair enough so you I generally until is it every it's I I usually hope on the slides
Yeah same
usually I don't but I like I think the slides this for this um content are like not helpful
Yeah that makes sense I think yeah
cause I look at them and I'm like what is going on
I had sure because he explains most of it in the lecture
Yeah I mean there are recordings I think on trunk of his lectures but like I think I'm just gonna try reading it cause the the textbook is like like w it's written in a way that like helps you out cause like doc is like I know this is hard like I know this confusing but like let me explain it like a certain way
Sense yeah seasons this time around smart computational which is annoying
I like seriously don't know anything like I I go through lab and like I didn't sit with someone and they like tell me honestly answer
Yeah I one that's my lab is lead to the like
wait I I I feel like you might be in my lab
Do you have Julia
are you
yeah
uh B
Yeah we're in the same love
Yeah
I think she's a she's like a cuddle researcher for this uh
Yes our name on here too
Test
yeah
Yes strange and realize you're my like
yeah
Yeah I don't think think I've I like saw you in pass
Like I'm I might have noticed you've for like there's also a couple other Asians I converted
Yeah there's a lot Asian his
Another the lab was bad I didn't look at the lectures and like
yeah
I don't fee I feel like she's not I mean
I mean she's very chill
Yeah I like her but like I don't know how helpful she is
It was in this recording
Yeah I know and like
Do you know Sir I is
no what's her what
Oh like every my give really look her eyes like her people's is like strangely shaped
really
I didn't notice
Yeah did like
I guess I'll have to look
Thank not like they are P people's a normal like circular shaped or a
Yeah
Yeah her is like a teardrop shape yet
really
that's cool
I think it's the interesting
It is cool
Concerning a cat like look at thank
I haven't been to her office hours or anything
Me either
And like I'm I'm pretty screwed for this yeah I did well on the first one but like this one and it's like way way worse cause I I took AP stat
in high school so like
I hope so
I'd learn most of the stuff but not not this stuff
How the hopes if first test I could them better but like hat was a bad week I like three tests and like ones chemistry
Yeah and had like so many tests
Yeah
Chem she like took all my time for studying I did not
yeah Pre med yeah
I hate myself
where do you live on campus
I live in Lewis
Same before
First for
on the third floor
Thirty four
yeah
Stranger in this names psych lab a real live in the same dorm
feel like
I know
We may must be in all the same classes
This solution what way whether class soon
We went to the same
um I take linguistics um Chinese three sta
I don't wanna whenever people ask me the classes i take I always forget at least one
No I haven't suite on the why
oh God have to like go to my sche oh comp sci comp eleven  a
Comp sci
oh what's the last one
This always happens
Or
U
Music theory of music
Music theory linguists mute
Yeah
Sir can John your class
In which class music theory
Me neither linguistics or music theory
linguistics I don't know anybody cause I don't go to class
I mean it's it's like
I say that stat like the stuff that we learn is like pretty like esoteric and like not useful but like linguistics is like on a whole nother level of useless
It's
and Like it's if you ever wanted to know what like the the bilabial valer like tract of your like tongue is then like take linguistics otherwise do not
What what is that
it's like it's in
wait it's j̲ust the intro
yeah
okay o̲
but like it's ∇w̲ay
mm
than I was expecting
which if you like maybe if you went to like a h̲igher like level linguistics it'd be m it'd be more interesting
I m̲
probably
I don't kno̲
cause I feel like more m
you have to build on those
cause I feel like most intro classes are ⁎like m
yeah exactly that's why it's like really specific
so it's like kind of boring
s oh
I I'd like it's if it was general I think I would enjoy it mo̲re actually
oh
no
nevermind then
Yeah
I mean it's required for CBS majors
Yeah I my friends also CVS house comp sci eleven junior
uh did I mention that I hate my life I hate my classes um it's like it's it's not bad honestly I I'm doing pretty well so
it's just all the homeworks take forever
Yeah I heard that too
Yeah
Television
As long as I make through comp fifteen if I can't make it through then I have to like totally change everything
Oh my god
I don't know I don't cause comp fifteen I'm like worried cause after that you ta you take that you take like one hundred level course in comp sci and then like you don't have to take anymore for CBS
yeah
Comp sci they were just like the the hard like super hard comp sci class
Comp forty
Company as
Yeah
You don't
and comp fifteen's supposed to be pretty hard so
Them are you to do with the come forty two or no no
Yeah
That's good
Yeah
It's good
And if I don't if I decide to like if I can't handle comp fifteen I could just minor and you don't need to take come fifteen
We should
huh
A what moment you wanna be a CVS major
um I mean I thought about psychology but then like I kind of wanted to like diversify you know
so
Yeah basically and comp sci's like pretty interesting I like it
Yes for interesting
And I'm thinking about like pre law stuff so
Pre law
yeah
There's in the pre law court
Now
There's like I took um
I mean just the perfect the the bar and everything on your own
Yeah and the LSAT yeah um I took sociology of law
O
And there's like a couple like random law classes there's like philosophy of law
And then like business law
And stuff
What a flaw
I haven't taken the like apparently like you don't really have to take law related stuff before you go to law school which is like kinda worrisome cause like I don't know if I really like it until I go to law school and like if I go to law school and I don't like it then like what do you do
That's true
Yeah
Lawyers
lawyers
Or
CBS is supposed to be a good like pre major if you're or major undergraduate majors if you're looking for law stuff
Wait why why is it so
cause just like psychology and then like you have to take logic and stuff
Oh
for CBS so
kay
or Like house of that
although I'm like
Debating about like the importance cause like law school like GPA and your LSAT score are like the number one most important things so like I'm not sure if I should like switch out of CBS to like an easier major so that I can have a high GPA cause there's like cause the apparently like law schools don't care like what's where what your what you did in undergrad as long as your grades are high
like there's like they they'd rather take like a four point oh in like film and media studies over like a three point four in like engineering or something
That's
That's odd why is that
cause like I mean I think it's just like the schools like want want the higher rankings from like their a their average GPA is high so they get more money you know
Why um
yeah
it's like I'd say I think it's like I it's nice cause it's not as like subjective as like choosing a undergraduate college cause like it's just like pure like GPA and LSAT but like kinda sucks
That's true favor the easier hm
yeah
What is med med school like what's the process I don't know anything I have like one Dr friend
Well
Do you know
Um I should probably should research into more of it I know that starting from next year should prepare for the
well I should take ish prepare like right I kinda like slight prepare right now for the MCAT
And then you you take the fucking test and then you apply it to a bunch of schools and hope you get in
yeah I mean I had like an existential crisis while I was studying comp for my exam I had an exam yesterday I was like instead of studying I was like looking up like law school statistics
and stuff like I was like what do I do with my life
Yeah
No don't do that
yeah look up the stats for getting into med school I'm like yeah I'm scared
yeah
U
Some rough careers
Yeah
it's worrying
How you reckon it's been already
Oh yeah I don't even know what time is it
The walk here was really long
Yeah and I I went to the wrong place
Yes same I thought it'd be
In the psych building
Closer
But I guess the set up is in the thing
Yeah this is too legit
It's two forty two
So when did we get here you got here at like two twenty
mm
so like
Its fair
And like fifteen twenty minutes
what an engaging conversation
I know right totally
wait w What's the purpose of u with them recording to us again I forgot
They're like gonna analyze our like social uh cu
Oh like our body language and what wedo
Yeah
Huh oh shit
cause I don't think
I mean I guess they are they don't they do care about the content of the conversation but
It's mostly like social I took social psych freshman year so like
I feel like I should know more
Yeah
But I don't
I heard social psych was pretty fun actually
yeah it's really fun it's probably my favorite class that I've taken at Tufts
cause the professor was awesome
Yeah my roommate said it was pretty awesome cause like uh didn't they have you take like in class like social experiments or something
We did some yeah
Yeah it sounds pretty fun
But like the content was just really great in the textbook was fun to read also
Nice
yeah
and it was like so easy and like so easy
huh
I didn't uh I mean I did go to class because it was fun honestly
but like it's pretty easy
that's pretty nice
U
Have you finished your like distribution requirements
for just school or like
Yeah just like school
I mean have you finished like h h how far along are you
What do we need English that's writing that's done
Um yeah
And then like
and Then world civ
What counts as a world civ again do culture classes count
yeah
I like get those I think I get those done like mm soon ish
cause I think they also count for like towards your language right if you take like four courses of a language and then two courses of a culture
Yeah I think I I mean I kinda screwed up cause I thought I would be jun done with Chinese last semester but like I I apparently they don't count like together I took Chinese cinema freshman year
mhm
and then Chinese one and two and I thought that was it cause I took French I'd passed out of three semesters of French so that would been six total semesters but like apparently you have to get to at least Chinese three before
cause you need like three semesters of two languages to pass out
O
But then like now I can use the Chinese cinema as my world civ so I'm done with that
but And then after world civ so this will natural sciences
Which I
probably don't need to worry about
yeah
Yeah
cause I took like f
yeah
you're gonna take like fifty
And then
and like social sciences humanities and arts
what counts as a social science again
I don't remember
it's like psychology sociology
Oh yep that's definitely done soon
yeah
Arts
And math there's math also
oh fuck man that's sta don't z stats co̲unts as math
I think this counts as m̲ath yeah
yeah t this counts
Well this I mean our the class that we're both in
yeah
Art classes
oh
Oh considering taking psychology of music I think it counts as both like a psych class
Yeah I think I might take that next semester
The it doesn't count as psych and as a art class
I think so
oh yeah
And like I'm thinking about minoring in music
minoring in Music
like a very
Music theory is there someone named is is there a curt in your class
Yeah Curt's cool
yeah Curt's pretty nice maybe he's
The music theory is like
Pretty fun right the professor is really cool but like if I didn't already like I just played piano for like ten years but
For just like ten years
yeah if I did
that's that's a lot
I did that if I hadn't done that I feel like I would have dropped it after the first week cause it's like pretty like hard to pick up
wait playing piano counts as a hobby
Yeah I know I totally forgot I had there just like coming to me
what
Ten years you forgot
Yeah I mean I played piano and I play um trumpet and I played guitar for little I played violin for a little
Wow that's that's a lot of music there
Yeah I forgot
That's that's that's quite A big part of your hobby
I forgot my entire life
yeah
Ten years
Um yeah I mean I was in marching band and stuff in high school
That's pretty cool
Yeah
it's a big part of your life that you just forgot
I know I Just like once I got to tufts I lost all identity
holy shit
Uh so you still still sticking with your instruments right
damn that's a lot of instruments
I think for
The music minor you have to like plan an ensemble for your
mm
Hey take private lessons for like two semesters
I'm glad you stuck with the I'd I had I played chello but I I gave up after high school
chello chello's a cool instrument
Yeah but I was like really bad and I didn't take any private lessons and so I like
just like stayed at this at a crap level
I wish I had taken private lessons for trumpet instead of piano cause like I wish I was better at trumpet and like I don't need to be that good at piano to like have fun with it
Yea
um
I was the the drum major in my high school he like the person that conducts on the field
Oh oh well I wouldn't know cause I we didn't have a marching band in my school
Our program was like
probably one of the biggest in like
the area
that's pretty s
it was like
wait where were you from
I'm from Philly
Philly alright
yeah
what about you
New Jersey
I used to live in New Jersey I moved from
You it F Chesterfield you haven't
is that in uh the north part of Jersey
It's near like trenton
Okay yeah it's like too far
Yeah
and it's also like tiny like you can drive there in like thirty seconds
Oh
it's curtains on the
yeah there are
I wonder what that's fr
that's strange
so you still play piano like uh do p what do you practice here
Yeah
um There's like practice rooms in Granoff
Granoff
mm
Yeah
and that's like you have to for music theory like there's a lot of like you can give us he gives us packets and like you have to like figure out the chords and stuff so like you just go to the practice rooms to do that
Wait a me isn't in music theory
Do you guys don't make your own compositions do you no
Umm
or is it a s is it a different class
mm there's like a final project that you can but like they made their songwriting there's a songwriting class
mm
I think I'm probably gonna take that next semester
Nice is there a Vanessa Zigel in our class second one or something
I don't know I don't know a lot of people I have like one close friend in that and then I know Curt like barely
oh right
fair
like we've met a couple times yeah
I feel like I don't
Have a lot of friends in my classes this semester
besides you obviously
um
what
Like I feel like
I haven't like not a lot of people from like taking classes this semester which I did a lot last year
I mean I guess to be fair psych stats is like too large
Yeah stats is like too big
To talk to people
Linguistics is like ninety plus and then
but yeah you don't even go to linguistics
and I don't go
Um and comp sci I guess I have made some friends in comp sci
yeah
comp eleven
Is there a an Annahita  in your comp eleven class she's like
I don't know I mean there are a lot of people in comp but the the like I met people my lab and I don't know that person
alright fair
hm
so what do you normally do on the weekends then
what do I do um I recently joined the Vietnamese students club so like I've been doing stuff for them
Do they hold mixers as well
yeah
Course
Are you in like CSE or something
no
I mean my friends and my roommates in KSA the the bottom culture chair
He calls images like every week
yeah I mean itt's like it's like a different environment to what I've been used like last year I just like hung out with white people
oh really last year I was just hanging out with Asians mostly
yeah
Yeah
probably because we all like had common interests
I mean I wish I had joined I'd just joined to see like this semester I wish I had joined earlier
mhm
That's because well at least you joined now so you can still experience it
Yeah
Vietnamese do I know of anyone in there
Yea
I don't think I know anyone
You a party person
like occasionally
how about you
no you're not
No I haven't gone to a single party
oh really they're like they're not that great like Tufts parties are pretty like bad honestly
Yeah I heard s I I read a post and
I mean it's like it
people are always like they're like the goal is like to go to a frat and like have fun and stuff but then like that every time I go like I go with my friends and then they're all like itching to leave this as soon as we get there like
I don't know
Is it that bad I mean read a person on like Tufts secrets to like misses shit on parties here at tufts but I don't know
yeah I mean they like they're not great just cause and there was whole like frat controversy stuff and then like now they're just like not that fun I can't say certain scene that you have to be a part of
That's true I can't relax at parties it's like too much going on for me to chill out
yeah
Can you the private and like small parties but the ones a
yeah
yeah I feel that
have you ever gone clubbing before
clubbing no
Yeah I went once and it was no
it's like that's like the as The antithesis of what I want too
It's like
It's like it's horrible so loud so many people
Yeah clubs are kinda
I couldn't do that
No yeah it's
Yeah
mm Do you think that guy is like sitting there is he like left and he's coming coming back
I don't know
I think he probably left cause he said I'll come get you in a half hour like
oh that's true maybe he's on a lunch break or something
yeah
hm
yeah
I wonder what other stuff because I feel like I'm in a movie
I know right this is such like
This like reminds me of there's that one scene in Thor or something
where like a little can loki showed up to meet him and there's like someone's dead like
someone's dead
it was such a convoluted
like
Maybe there was a scene I don't know it's been a lost the saw thor
uh I think the new one came out
oh ragnarok
thor ragnarok yeah
mm
head it was supposed to be good I want I mean I used to watch a lot more movies but like recently I just don't have time
That's true it's time consuming isn't like is thor supposed to die or something
I think that's the rumor
I mean like but it doesn't seem like the kind of vibe
cause like
Like the move like the trailers the stuff seems like very like guardians of the the galaxy kind of
mm That's true
cause I
I like the story I think from the comics is that in ragnarok thor dies
Yea
so
I don't
How show that in like was Hulk even supposed to be in Ragnarok
I have no idea
How is how do you get there why is Bruce Banner's in
Yeah
It's like pretty crazy I don't know why I I like Marvel Marvel movies like kind of soured on me recently
How come I mean I recently saw Spiderman homecoming that was like pretty nice
cause they're about they've all been kind of the same I mean I haven't watched I watched like doctor strange and I was like it like pretty average
pretty average
so
okay
yeah
like we can either not like bad but like they're not like innovative
mm
that's true
Like they used to be
I mean at least they're not as bad as the DC movies
yeah Of course I mean wonder woman is actually really good
I haven't seen wonder I want to see it though
it was really good
yeah
I liked it a lot
hey
It was pretty long I feel like but like I didn't really notice
how long it was
should probably go see it sometime
Yeah
Have you seen it
I'm Not a horror movie guy
The clown fuckery
I'm not a horror movie guy I mean not that not that I get scared but like I just like they're not that appealing to me
How come
Is like pretty boring it's just like a lot of it is like jump scares and like relying on like certain tricks to make sure
That's true though I think I think it's based on like a novel like Stephen king's novel or something
I heard it's good I mean I feel like if I watched it I'd probably enjoy it but like
I wouldn't go out of my way
it's like decent
It like it's more of like a story with like a scary story so it's not like a shitty plot
oh
though I hate clowns though
it makes me hate clowns even more
Yeah I h I ha when I was a when I was like seven or eight it wasn't at like a show and they had like a clown show off like in the intermission and like he did this act and he pi he picked me I was like sitting on the edge on like aisle
Yeah
And he like picked me up and vacuumed me
vacuumed you
Like he had a hand vacuum and he like vacuumed me for some bit and I was like
What
I hate clowns forever
what the
yeah it was pretty
it was not
like even like I haven't seen like an
Have you seen an actual clown like working
Yeah that clown
Like literally like not
The clown that vacuumed me
and like recently
No I mean
I haven't seen like a clown in like an like an actual clown
Yeah I mean I feel like it's just a it's a pretty outdated phenomenon
It's a good dying profession
Yeah
He had to go to clown school
there an actual clown school
All right so how's everything g̲o̲ing
It's going okay um this is my only day to sleep late ish this week so that was really nice
I woke up like twenty minutes ago laughs
Yeah same
I had to drive here really quick
Me too me too I like
Yeah
Looked at my agenda and saw that this was at two hundred Boston Ave and I was like oh well guess I'm not walking
Yeah I have another one too at
Can't do that
The regular psych building
Okay
I think at eleven or eleven fifteen
Oh wow nice
Yeah I double booked myself so are you a ⇗junior or senior
that's good
senior
Oh nice okay me too
Okay cool
Yeah
Cool what are you gonna do next
Uh actually I'm going into consulting next year
Oh nice so you already know
Yeah
Cool this tea is like a little too hot
I'm pretty sure the milk was actually bad
inaudible
So I don't wanna say anything though
really
oh that's so gross
But it like flaked off and I smelled it and it was gross so was just like
Did you put it in your
No
I wonder if that's part of the experiment
I was thinking that the whole time like ⇗what is part of the expehriment laughs
Yeah there was one time that I was tricked for one of these for intro to psych
Oh really
Yeah um like the other participant was actually a plant
So like when I first came in and saw you I thought that you were a plant hehehe
yeah that was pretty rough but anyway so you're gonna do consulting where is that gonna be
Luckily in Boston
Nice
Yeah
I I'm so uh I'm not sure if you know anything about consulting but
Like a little
Yeah I I unfortunately do
Okay
But um I'm choosing between a firm called Oliver Weinmann and another one called Deloitte so I
Oh yeah I know Deloitte
Yeah I just have to make make a decision at some point in the next week
I've heard of that
Yeah
geez
Although I assume
congrats
yeah it's funny cuz I'm an English major
Right
And I could not be dumber at eighty percent of the stuff that you need for consulting
but cuz it don't they like ask you stuff during the interview like How many marbles will fit in an airplane
Oh yeah
It's a ton of math and I can't I'm in psych stats for my math requirement
Yeah
So like clearly not
Yeah
Like a math person
It's so bad I had some guy ask me I was doing it's you do these things called mark uh market sizing where they'll ask you how many cabs are let's say in New York City
Okay
Okay
And you just have to figure it out from mentally
Yeah
Thinking about all these factors and I had to do something like seven times forty two hundred and I looked at the guy and I was like look thehhre's not an answer ⁎I don't know⁎ I'm gonna be honest hehe And he was like okay
That's so stressful but you got it that's kind of cool
Yeah seven yeah that that was a different one but somehow that went okay
Wow
Nice
Yeah you meet the ust you meet the oddest people
Uhuh
For like for that one I completely fucked up every part of it but the whole day they were saying you know we have this guy named Hank he's brilliant he's your last interview they're like our clients can't get enough of Hank and then this guy waddles in in the end
Mhm
and he's like clearly neurotic he's got like overlapping bottom teeth and he has my resume and he keeps flipping it over and over even know hh there's nothing on the back
mhm
Oh my god I can't I like know exactly the kind of person you're talking
And I'm thinking like holy shit
yeah
About
And then he's like alright I'm gonna give you a graph and I want you to solve it so he writes this graph with like eleven different lines going LATCH
mhm
and he's like all right solve this and I'm like I don't know what the fuck I'm looking at
so I start making shit up and he's like that's all wrong and then he takes it back and he's like I drew it wrong he crosses everything out gives me like another eleven lines and I'm like dude I can't read it and he's like ⁎of course⁎
And he takes it back does anoth nother one a new one and gives it to me and I was like I and he's like you know what I drew it wrong again and I was like okay
Did he ever draw it right
No he was like let's just do let's just talk haheheh
I wonder if that was part of the test
I think he's just c uh my idea is that he goes into a conference room everyday
mhm
And gets like everything wrong and everyone at the company is like ⁎he's brilliant he's done it again⁎ hehe
That's so crazy wow haha
He's my idol it was like it was a firm calledl Novantis and it's extremely analytical
Okay
Modeling for finance
Okay
Which is pretty much like the absolute opposite of what I'd be good at
Okay
But he's a philosophy major
Oh cool
And he's like a huge partner at it and I was like you're ↓my hero
That's awesome
Yeah
I'm a big proponent of people just like majoring in whatever they like and then just doing something else random with it
Yeah
Um that's kind of what I'm doing with anthropology I think like just I'm not gonna do anything with anthropology probably in my future but I like it
Oh really
What was the other one biology
So
biology
That's a pretty good one to have
Yeah yeah uh
I have a lot of respect for that because of the amount that I would be bad at it
would be astronomical hhh
I bet you could do it I mean it's honestly just like memorizing patterns and then applying those patterns to other things and like once you understand like how something
That does make it sound pretty good
Yeah so like once you learn how to play the biology game
Yeah
like you're good it's like orgo like
for English once you know how to read you're set
see that's what I'm struggling with right now oh my god I
you're really good haha haha
Oh my god I am questioning my like general reading comprehension comprehension I have to like present on these two like uh one ten page reading and one twenty page reading for my class on Wednesday I spent literally all of Saturday trying to read these thirty pages and I just like and they were so simple they were like ethnographic just like a story and I was just like so I don't know I I think like I'm a senior in college but I still like can't comprehend readings
Do you ever have to write essays for any of your classes
Anthropology all the time
Oh okay
So
There you go
I mean I used to be able to do it I think somewhere like within the past six months I just like forgot how to do
Yeah
Reading and writing
That's my fear is that I'll graduate I'm gonna go into uh consulting which I find really interesting
mhm
Uhhuh
But I don't know if I'm gonna have to be writing in the same way that I write now
Uhhuh
And mainly I have to also say that cuz if this is out there I really need to talk about the fact that I do like consulting
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
Can you actually explain like why consulting firms hire students directly out of college like ∇who presumably don't have the experience of the∇ people that they're consulting for like that's something that's
Yeah
I think is an interesting phenomenon
Probably just because uh we're cheaper
Okay
Than An actual Experienced hire
That makes sense
yeah also I think to b like consulting itself means absolutely nothing
That's what I've always thought hhh
Yeah it means the word itself means definitely nothing because it could mean anything
Okay
I mean if I was telling my dad which shoe to put on I'd be consulting him
Right fair
But um a lot of people say the job of the consultant is to take someone's watch off their arm and tell them what time it is
Okay
I I mean I don't know if that's true or not cuz I I did it last summer but I don't really know what it's like
Cool
To do for couple years
Uhhuh
I just think you get to learn so much about so many different industries
mhm
and your only job is to learn and the idea is that a third party who is supposed to be smart from a good college
That's cool
mhm
will be able to have some insight into what someone else is doing
mhm
maybe they're too engrossed to be able to see
Oh okay
So you get to have a lot of experience in a lot of t different industries
That's cool
So yeah for that stuff I think it's gonna be really fun
Yeah that is gonna be fun
But
I've also heard my hours are from ↓seven AM to twelve AM so
Nice
Might be tough for me
Yeah okay well you just won't have a social life but weekends
uh yeah no I think so I usually you're supposed to travel Monday through Thursday but I am gonna be living with my Twelve best friends from college probably
Okay
Oh what wow all in ∇one house∇
Probably that's what I want yeah haha
Oh my god
In Boston
That's gonna be amazing and probably the only way you can afford to live in Boston
So
Yeah we're probably going to have to live in like Sommerville hehe
Yeah
Yeah
That's awesome wow that's really cool that you're all ending up in Boston because like right now
Yeah
All of my friends are like okay New York Boston Chicago San Francisco like Kind of all
Yeah it's also scares like all your friends like when are you gonna see them again if you don't live with them
I know
I know
yeah
it what's so weird is that like next we have to make adult friends
I don't wanna do that I'm not gonna do it
Okay that's it sounds hard I mean this summer like I was in Boston but like you know like I had friends here but they were coming and going so there would be like a week where like three my friends would be out of town and
Yeah
I like find found myself like trying to make work friends but like how can you make work friends like I was at a really weird level where like I spent a lot of time working with my bosses and then a lot of time working with people who are under me but like no one really on my level
Oh that's rough yeah
So
it was like who am I friends with or like how do I form relationships that aren't just professional
Yeah
That is tough
That's kind of weird
Yeah luckily u uh everyone at most people I worked with were our age LATCH
That's nice
Yeah and one kid was just he's brilliant at math but he was a meth addict and went to a Buddhist monastery to get clean he goes to MIT
What haha that's so crazy
He's like hopped up on he came to my house last week for a party and he comes up to me and he's like yeah dude I'm hopped up on valium right now and I was like dude you've had like eight beers
People are wacky heheha
and he was like yeah I hope nothing bad happens haha like ⇗you gotta get a get out of my house heheh
Oh my god that's nuts hhh
But all summer he'd be like wake up have McDonald's uh lunch he would have Taco Bell and he would like have Wendy's at night he would have like eight cups of coffee
Oh my god
Couple beers during work
Oh my god
and then he would smoke in the morning and at night hh
Oh my god
Everyday
he was a tank he was unreal
That's insane
Yeah he
That's such a wacky person wow just thinking about that makes my stomach hurt and like
Brilliant brilliant though I know he's gonna definitely die in like five years but before that hhhappens hh he's gonna be brilliant
Wow it's so interesting to think how like drugs make people more or less productive or more brilliant
Some people get really productive from it
Yeah
Which is odd to me
Yeah at I was in a class last year I guess that we talked about umm bio hacking I think is what it's called in Silicon Valley
Yeah
Where like people are just taking so many drugs to like be more productive
Yeah I know what you're talking about yeah
yeah
that would never work for me
Yeah
No I feel like I mean if I smoked I'd be done I'd be like all right
Yeah
I'm out hhh
That's true that's true I think I have too much anxiety about like my general health and then like
oh Yeah that's another thing I like
What my mental state would be like
I Yeah I just don't want to f like fuck my body up
Right yeah
Yeah
yeah
I'm pre med and like
Oh yeah
working in a hospital right now
Oh that's cool
Yeah it is really cool but I was never a hypochondriac before and now I'm like I have diabetes and I have
That would freak me the fuck out yeah
Like all these infections and like yeah
Even spending a lot of time in a hospital I'd be like I must've contracted something today
I definitely got pink eye one time from work
Really hahah
yeah
it was really sad
That's horrible
Because I think I like do a lot of hand sanitation you know like I'm always
Yeah
Washing my hands but hhh still still happened hhh
Hehe yeah that I couldn't do that
yeah
Yeah
It's fun though
That is really cool to me and this is an odd opinion I mean I think my profession will be extremely fun
Mhm
and I'll get to learn a lot but I viewalmost being a doctor as the only meaningful
Mhm
Ohh
profession
That I can think of other than being a teacher which is what I want to do in my like fifties
Yeah
Oh that's a really cool path
I def yeah I definitely want to be an English teacher by the time I'm fifty I wanna like pay for my kids colleges by the time I'm forty five
Mhm
Yeah
And then immediately become an English teacher
Smart very smart yeah cuz you can't do that starting with English teaching Probably or it
Yeah
I cannot
it will be a lot harder I guess
Yeah the jump from English teacher to consulting will be much more difficult
Yeah yeah hhh
Yeah hhh
Neat
But
sounds like you've got a good
Plan though
Yeah I realize my plan will definitely fall through hhh
Why
Uh I feel I mean my dad wanted I think he wanted to be a history teacher when he was my age and  we are the exact same person in every way
mhm
mhm
But now he's been a lawyer for like thirty years and he started out doing it for
Oh
People who were uh what's it like labor law
Okay
But now he does intellectual property law for Merck and Pfizer
What does that mean
Uh pretty much let's say you're Merck do you know you know uh
Merck yeah the the drug company
Yeah
so let's say that they have a new drug they need to patent it so that no one else can pretty much use the same drug and that they can collect all the market from it
mm
mhm
mhm
my dad makes sure that when that patent is challenged by another company let's say Merck thinks that oh Pfizer came out with something but it's too similar to ours
mhm
Mhm
and they don't want it to be sold to anyone else my dad will go in and be like errerererer
Hhh and pretty much make sure that Merck uh keeps their patent and that Pfizer can't sell whatever they sold
Wow
Yeah which there are
That's interesting
Societal benefits but mainly societal downsides too
Yeah I guess so I mean
Drug companies are interesting and like a tough thing for me to wrap my head around because like
Yeah
their bottom line like yes they're bettering the world with medicine but
Yeah so much of its insane profit driven
They're also so much about profit yeah
Yeah
Which is everything honestly like even being a doctor like
Yeah
You go into work
That's true
Probably
at least partially because you're getting paid for it and like
Yeah
is a high it's a good paying job
Yeah
But to me it's like a job where it's like good paying but you're doing actually so much good
Yeah
Every day
Hopefully hopefully
Yeah
Yeah
That's the goal
I mean my dad l my dad's like
Amazingly weirdly smart
uh huh
he's like a history major
Yeah
And is doing things with science somehow
Yeah that's amazing
That make no sense to me so
That's really cool wow
He probably gets he gets a kick out of that part of it
Yeah I'm sure
Yeah
I mean I guess it's something good to look forward to that even though like we're academic our academic career kind of is ending soon like we're still gonna to be learning and changing and
Which is weird yeah
yeah i just wanna yeah i don't really want that to stop
Get into different fields
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah like um two summers ago I worked at a coffee shop in San Francisco um
That's chill
I was really chi actually no it wasn't very chill like It was
Yeah
umm a very strict coffee shop like I had to wear a tie to work and
Oh really in San Francisco
I actually
yeah and I actually got fired on like my last week which is like a whole nother complicated story but um like I would get anxious and stressed out and like unhappy because I wasn't like thinking and like
Expanding my Horizons and using my brain and
Yeah
Yeah
I like think that I need to have a certain baseline level of like academic stress at all times or else I like have all this stress ya
Yeah that's that's why I want to do consulting yeah
it's like the closest thing I can think of to college
Yeah
Without still being a college
Yeah
Yeah even if it's just perpetual finals period hehe forever hehe
Fair
Yeah
At least you'll like be in it together I assume like will you be working on a team like all consulting together as a team
Yeah
Oh yeah and it's great because it's gonna be all kids my age too
That's really awesome
For at least who I come in with
Yeah yeah
Yeah
so do they do like some sort of Rotational program to get you on track to know how to consult or how does that work
They'll probably just throw me on a project
Wow
And that's actually that's what I did this summer
Okay
And yeah this summer was actually uh I worked at place called Cap Gemini in DC
Oh okay I think I've heard of that
And I had never heard of it but apparently it's like two hundred thousand people and I was like eh
Nice
I was I don't even know how I got it actually I don't remember heheh
But
I'm sure you worked hard to get it hhh
Yeah
But it was just pretty much I they gave us a project where it's like a we work for the government and it said find a government agency and fix it
Okay
Wow
Or fix a problem they have yeah
Okay I'm sure there's a lot of those
And
actually I wa I ended up working for the biotechnology regulatory service
Oh cool
so I worked with bio stuff
nice nice
Yeah hehe
Wow how do you like it
It was first I I worked on a team with the a girl named Jing who was out of her mind brilliant but didn't speak any english
mhm
and I worked with a teammate named John who worked remotely in Indianapolis
mhmm
Hmm
Oh wow
So we were and I was project leader so at first we were incredibly discombobulated
Wow
Yeah
Because none of us could communicate in the same area
That's nuts
But just through Skype happy hours inaudible Jing was a homie so I sat next to Jing every day
Uhhuh
and we had a good time
That's nice
But eventually I I we were looking up everything on the websites for this
mhm
and it was all saying the opposite shit for everything
Okay
So I just started calling like the emergency hotline number at BRS and I was like Hey there's no →emergency but I really need to speak to →someone heheh
That's crazy and did they connect you with someone
Yeah
and it
eventually they put me in touch with this guy named doctor Able who I talked to like every day
Okay
About what was I told him I'm like oh I'm a student at tufts I'm just hh really hh interested in it
Okay
Oh my gosh do the did they know that you were consulting and fixing your problems
No
Their problems that's really interesting
I felt really bad about that heh
That's really int so how are you allowed to do that or like who hired you how does that work
Well eventually that we put together this entire huge presentation on it was pretty much whenever let's say Monsanto who's a uh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
So let's say they want to change a plant
Mhm
and make it drought resistant
Uhuh
Then they're gonna try to augment it in some way with a new phenotype or some type of genetic enhancing
mhm
mhm
but whenever they go out and experiment it with in the open BRS is gonna go and test everything they're doing to make sure it's not harming the environment
Okay
The only thing is they might be like thirty thousand sites across the US and BRS incites them randomly
mhm
Okay
Which doesn't make much sense
Yeah
So I was saying you know if we just have I got all this data and I created all these models that say
mhm
Uhuh
pretty much there are more uh focused ways we can do this based on risk
mhm
and you can go for certain different plant types that you know are more risky
Hm
Huh
And then eliminate half the agency's costs and make it way more efficient and actually purposeful to help
Cool
a the environment
Yeah
So then we just kinda package this and we gave it to uh I think we may have sent it back to doctor Able but I left for that part hh
Wow
Wow so do you think they're gonna implement it
I hope so it makes a ton of sense
It does
Yeah
Yeah
After going out to the real world I realized like so many things are unecessarily shitty or like extremely poorly run
hhh I agree I agree yeah
And it's just like aw
And like way too complicated
Man
Yehah
And also like I have a theory that no one actually knows what they're doing
I think that's pretty accurate
Like how do you learn what you're doing I don't know it's just hhh ya I yeah
Yeah I have this increasing view that it's pretty much like children
mhm
but we just get bigger and start to try to like hh run the world pretty much
Right
Right right and have to be leaders but like
But
yeah
Are we even qualified for that
am yeah so much of it doesn't make so much of finance or even consulting is jargon to confuse laymen To think what we're doing is really Smart
Mhm hm
Same thing with medicine
Yep
Yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like
mhm
Yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like make a model
yeah
And figure it out
Yeah
Yeah
Hh but it works
Yeah I guess it does work hh
I mean
Yeah
That's really neat
Medicine I think is so cool
Hhh I also think it's so cool
Yeah
I love it umm ∇I'm very excited to ∇learn more
Do you know what you would be doing yet
Well I'm going through like phases so like  hh six months ago I was like I'm gonna be an ear nose throat doctor like that's just it that's definitely it um but right now I'm really into GI stuff so like gastro intestinal I think that's really neat
Hmm
um I think the colon is like the coolest part of the body heheh
um yeah all of my friends always make fun of me like Abbey says the colon is cool like →we should make a poster but
Hahaheh Sure
Could've been a colon for Halloween that would've been pretty tight LATCH
I hh should've been oh my god
that would've been pretty tight
Yeah
I was actually umm Sansa Stark from game of thrones though if you watch that we had a great group costume
Oh nice
Um yeah so that's kind of the plan right now I don't know I want to do colonoscopies and like endoscopies and
Yeah
Like fix people's stomach issues
You should have someone nice doing a colonoscopy we need like more probably like the nicest of possible doctors doing colonoscopies
Yeah right hehehe
Hh yeah
Hh yeah definitely
Yeah I mean it like everyone needs them every ten years or five years if they have an elevated risk and like
I've yeah ∇my grandpa had colon cancer∇ so I actually think I have to get one  for which I'm really not looking forward to much
Mm
Mm
But yeah
It'll be ⇗fun
Yeah no it will be fun
I mean
Like
I'll pregame it or something hhh
I think that's what the anesthesia's for
Do they give you anesthesia
Yeah yeah
That's better
Yeah
That'd be a much mor intimate relationship
that's much better
Yeah yeahha
otherwise yeah
although I think some people opt to stay weak and like watch it on the screen which like
Huh
Is interesting to see your own insides on a screen I can't even imagine what that would feel like
Hm
Yeah I'd just be like Doc you don't wanna go in there hehhe
Yeah haha
Yeah it's nuts but anyway uh when you were talking about like do working for the government with the Monsanto stuff like my mom does a lot of um she used to do like genetic modification for um MeadWestvaco
Okay
and they were working on making like more efficient trees
That's really cool
But
now she does like kind of the opposite she does water
yeah
Make trees less efficient
Hehe no no no um she's like the government monitoring she has her own water testing business so she's like monitoring construction companies to making sure make sure that they're not
Hmm
like
That's a societally useful useful job
Polluting water
yeah it's really cool and it's like her own little start up business but
That's really cool
I was always like raised in this house where we were like really cool with like GMOs and like genetic modification and like
Yeah
I don't really know I feel like everything is kind of GMO based casue I mean how I feel like it doesn't really matter something genetically modified because nature genetically modifies everything anyway
That's a good view point
So the stigmatation against it I don't really understand
Yeah
Yeah I feel like fertilizer that stuff or not fertilizers but uh whatever the chemicals pesticides pesticides I'd be more like
Yeah pesticides
We shouldn't ⇗do that
Right right like I'd rather
Yeah
Genetically modify something to be resistant
Yeah then have to give it pesticides to make it okay
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah I mean I guess it's like really complicated because we don't fully know what everything does to our body at this point
Yeah
So like I don't know we We yeah we're just
Stick with oreos
did you just say stick with oreos
Heh yeah
Hahaha you know they're vegan
Really
Yeah
Oh maybe I should've had one hehe
Are you vegan
No hh
Hhh I was considering being vegan on and off for awhile
Really
Yeah but I like ice cream too much but now they have vegan ice cream so
Yeah the problem for me is that the difference between vegan and vegetarian is too hard for me to remember so I don't think I could be a good either of them so there's just no way
Really you can't remember
No so there's just no way I could ever do it it's too complicated
Oh
it'd be like another level of stress
yeah that's fair I I was vegan for one week
hm
freshmen year
that's pretty good
Maybe it was sophomore year yeah it was pretty good it was it was awesome but I I keep kosher so I already kind of like
Oh nice
Have this ho well like kosher style like I'm not a very strict about it but um I already like have these dietary restrictions I feel like I
Yeah
I'm pretty good at understanding other dietary restrictions
like working on them
That's pretty good I pretty much make the same thing for dinner Every day
What is that
Just like chicken with avocado and like arugula tomatoes mushroom
That sounds really good for you
It is pretty good but I always make kale or Kale in the oven
Mm
and this summer I actually still have a scar on my stomach because I was I had a when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do
mhm
I ended up calling four hundred alumni from tufts
mhm
and asking them about their lives and what they do
Four hundred
A lot of people like in consulting finance or like John Tisch and heh
Wow that's awesome
I just was like panicking hh
Uh huh
He was really funny cause the first thing he says like so do you like the library and I was like yeah I'm in it it's a great it's a great library hh
He's like that's good that's good hehe
It's a good library hehe
He was like yeah but one of them got out there was some guy from I think McKenzie who was like a real hardo
mhm
and immediately start asking me questions about like discounted cash flows that I did not even ne really need to know for consulting
Mhm
but I was taking out a kale platter from the oven
While you were on the phone with this person
An
yeah
in DC and I'm shirtless cause that's why I don't want to cook otherwise
Uhuh
Uhuh
okay
And I bump into to my fridge and I pressed the thing into my stomach
Ah haha ow
But I realize as I do it it's incredibly unprofessional to burn your belly on a call
So I can't scream and be like aw hh man I'm sorry I just burnt my belly hehe
So I just had to pause and then keep talking on the phone about some ridiculous finance model
And just never let him know
Yeah hehe
that's so funny
Wow one time my dad was on the phone with the fire department because he does some like management work for them and while he was on the phone with the fire department in South Carolina he like put a plate of food in the microwave and it caught on fire hh
And he literally had to say to the fire department like I'm sorry like I have a small fire in my home like I have to go
They were probably like ah that's a good one heheh
Like a
Okay cool hh
Yeah very silly
That's pretty bad
Yeah wait where are you from
New York
Where in
Westchester Mamaroneck
Oh
yeah
cool cool
I'm from South Carolina
Oh okay nice yeah
Yeah
yeah
it's not I don't like it very much hh
Heheh I'm really bad with geography so I'm not sure if I know where anywhere is on a map
Oh okay
I pretty much only know where New York is on a map
Have you ever played that game where you have to like match the states to the right area or like patch match the name state to the state
Uhh no
It's really hard
That would've been really helpful for me though
Yeah
Growing up
My roommate and I like spent one Saturday night just like doing that for hours and we were really bad at it and then we moved on to like countries in Europe and in Asia and in Africa and
Yeah
like I thought like maybe I could do Europe
Europe I could maybe do but not like East Europe I would get confused
Yeah I know I couldn't even do western Europe like I realized I don't even know where Germany or France are which is like pretty
Yeah
Embarrassing hh but I haven't been there so I guess that
I went to Berlin
Is an excuse
I guess a year ago today almost
Oh wow
which is funny
that's cool
yeah
what for
Uh my girlfriend is she studied abroad there while I was in Scotland
Oh cool
And we went there was this thing called suicide club which is a like big club in Berlin
I think I've heard of it actually
Yes it's supposed to be famous I think I don't know
Yeah
I don't know who I would have heard of that from
But
We went at like five am when it was shutting down
mhm
And I just like went behind the bar and grabbed a random bottle of champagne and it turned out to be like a two hundred dollar bottle of champagne
That's really cool
And we bought like all this cheese
Uhhuh
And just had an amazing
That sounds awesome
Yeah amazing afternoon hehehe
Wow wow
But it was the coolest place I've ever been I hate like I went to Amsterdam and I hated it because it was so pretty and nice and I really
You're the first person I've heard to say that they hate Amsterdam
It was terrible it was like pretty bridge everywhere and I was like oh god hehe
Wow hehe
But I really need something like gritty and like som a little garbage on the street
Uhuh
That I think I love which I probably more New York
So like New York
yeah haha
yeah hh
So Berlin was perfect I was like this is a really play you couldn't tell what was trash and what was a club
That's interesting wow
That I was I was into that yeah
Wow I had an exchange student from Germany so I've been wanting to go
Really
oh it's so cool
To Germany to visit and see
I'm actually going back in a month hh
Wow cool
Yeah
for winter break or what is a month from now like
yeah
Oh I hope it's a month maybe it's not a month it's like a month and a half
Okay
Yeah
Nice that's really cool I've the only place I've been to in like continental Europe is Poland
Oh really
Which is it was like one of the Holocaust trips though so it was like not fun
oh u
I'm actually I think half Polish
Oh cool
And that was my Holocaust side so
I was also half Polish
Yeah
I am also half Polish but hhh
It was a cool trip but I went in January and it was miserable
Yeah
But all the Polish women were wearing like big fur coats and shorts and it was like this strangest
Oh really
style I guess to see how that was just the way that it
They have a fascinating culture
Yeah
Someone was telling me that it's definitely supposed to have like a kind of sad
mhm
like culture I hh guess
Yeah
And that they have this mushroom eating contest which is famous in Poland everybody does it
Really
And it's like one of their things that makes them all really happy
Okay
Except a lot of them die because they eat poisonous mushrooms
Whaht
Yeah but because it's so beloved people still do it all the time and every year like children will die from eating poisonous mushrooms
So wait
But they still do it
This mushroom eating contest like is it organized like a an
Yeah
I think they just go out into the forest and it's like go pick your mushrooms and everybody goes
Table and people just eat
Huh
Yeah
That's really interesting I've never heard of that before
Hmm
I was amazed by that I thought that is tough heh
Yeah
Yeah
Culture is so weird hehehe
Neat how was Scotland though for abroad

it's literally all inclusive it's like
∇some some do they therefrat gets sponsored by like some Mexican beer∇
Like drinks too food
So like ∇they get a sponsor∇ so it's like a deal it's like you go by the student
∇No way∇
they don't check i it's not like an ID it's like
Well yeah it's legal there
You just go no no no but ID of like the school like you don't like you go as a student of UCLA but you don't actually have to be a student

He had from other he had a friend in the frat who just his boy from California ghosts
But I'm obviously not in the frat like you know
Noble girls go to like it's like it's like a
Oh I see
It's a girls from but it's like through like they get the discou nt for this frat and the more people that go the better it is for the for like it better for everybody to have more people so they want more peo ple to go like the more the better
Oh I see you
Until they get sponsored by like some of skier beer

You fly into forty but out of political
Yes yeah
So like it would be a lot of money to just go up to Rio and come back

What's the worst thing if you're gonna take away don't take language at all
I have a bunch of kids on my floor taking up or just like
Let's discuss the I mean what it now I mean it's nice but
And the first classes very easy
Yeah
But on second class is still easy but hello harder than does the I'm every through right now for the last test philosophy class for the language requirement
Yeah
And that's been killing to it's harder than Orgo it's harder than psych stats is harder than
Damn
Whatever whatever influences
Hi
Feel bad for the kids on my for them because they seem to want to stick with the
You know yet those four
Yeah
A radio all the new freshman are really
Motivated home like they don't know what's going to happen
Good at the like it's rock just couple more couple semesters them if well

Medieval art of the Mediterranean and then one other class that for physics world
What is a medieval art in the Mediterranean like
Well it it really it's very simple it's so
Yeah
Going back to like art or Christian Islamic Jewish art it's analyzing it in context of Byzantine culture and then like from that from like at the end of the Roman so it's Greek era all the way up to like late medieval
So it's like a a broad type of thing since you're covering so many years or is it
y
Yeah
No for each center if we'll have like
Twenty five s specific pieces of art and how they relate in context
What type of the clubs do you hear anything like that
I don't do too much because I live close enough
Yeah
I just did what it could I only continue all suffer I still
Yeah
So right now I work in Boston children's doing neuro bio research an EMT which I got over the summer
um but that's like jobs
not that much intramuralsoccer and Pre medand like I just don't have too much time
yeah
gotcha
Yeah I see like pre med you got a job too and allthat stuff yea hard to get extra
Yeah
Things in there it's a lot of stuff to do
Oh you have you probably have a decent amount of time no
Yeah
Yeah
uh
You play
not sure this is an OIR actually It could have turned into one but it didn't get all the way out but feel free to disagree
oh the season's over right
Yeah which kind of sucked because it was so short but
Eh
Whatever
Do you like soccer
Yeah a lot
I
Me too do you watch it too
A lot
Oh beautiful we only have like another half an hour
Yeah
Plus of material to talk about okay
Who's your team
Liverpool
Oo Chelsea
okay that's good well that's fine
Yeah it's not the worst it just I don't know Liverpool I just have such mixed emotions about because they could be so good but they just they just aren't at the same time
What are you saying
OIR
Like their their front line is amazing
mhm
But when theydon't
Yeah no
Fire well
Yeah that'd be
really bad
That'd be a great buy
mm but
Him and  would be very good together
yeah I was very happy I feel  really under rated
repeat
Yeah
Especially when  brought him over and I was like that's really nice
Yeah
It was free too
Yeah it was a great free transfer amazing transfer
Yeah Chelsea's doing fine right
We kinda got smacked by Roma the other day
oh yeah champions league
yeah
was he suspended
He wa
OIR to ask about "coming back
Kanté's in ↓oh Kanté oh so so they Antonio C̲onte yea yeahI thought you meant like
Yeah
na̲h
Antonio Kant uh C̲onte
na
Yeah no he
Okay
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
He had like a hamstring injuryI think
Yeah
I hate that you guys got him so much I hated that sell
oh I know
I hate that because I feel like you just he belonged at Lester
He was sucha steal too
I hate when that happens somuch
I know
Because like other clubs like Liverpool it's not like Liverpool d d don't have the money
Yeah
To get it it's like
He just chose
I think the fact that contact was our coach the fact even laughed because like
Home in like
He's a yeah
Yeah
But we got him for such a steel to I don't know how Lester allowed that much money to be paid for I'm like I think it was thirty two million pounds
I'm in that's two three years ago
Yep it's
Sti
That's even then like even now even though the transfers now are skyrocketing like back then I easily could have see him being worth like
Yes fifty something
Yeah what he does for a team is incredible he'd what early holds us together
Yeah that's what I'm hoping do you know the guy from late lice big kia day
Oh are Keita Keita
Not okay tell yeah nine magnat and Abby's not be Kate that
Yeah
Yeah
We signed him but he's come at the end of the sun end of the season
Yeah
Which sucks another twenty gonna in the winter transfer which I mean
That be good if you can get an earlier but
I don't think the of I don't know if he's gonna the so
I don't think he is honestly Leipzig kinda seems like a different sort of team and Liverpool
I diving watch much from the sleep of the soon I don't watch much of anything this year
Yeah
Who's months of the
I mainly watch Leipzig in the champions league
Yeah yeah
But third Thurgood to either really good team but I don't know Keita seems more like a this is like a box to box type midfielder when you guys need some defense of stability Henderson doesn't really
I understand you three so I mean
Oh yeah
Every thought is of me the next year ride and then like
Yeah
He disappeared
Yeah he was really good in your of the season you guys got second
Yeah
He was amazing
Everybody was some isn't only like
Yeah
No Colo Tory was some is a
The fair
That's a good point
Still the I feel so bad because he was playing so amazingly he ran your team and then just seasons after
I was a different oh my god I remember the season because like
Yeah
Yeah
So good
And then Gerard slept
Well stuff stuff so we can suffer the
I'm sorry I had to bring it up
That's so there's not
I saw that I was traumatized like second hand
Those against Chelsea to
Yeah I was watching that I was so conflicted
Everybody what and it's like a little moments where you like the what to any member like what come the day
Yeah
What happens like all he was there so close
Yeah
He felt
Uhm to demo by running it on there as like oh god why did this have to happen to Gerrard
He's yeah no even haven't really color the fenders like it would with so less impactful like on his legacy
Yeah yeah because all he's never won a pram
We're gonna open
O
Let me know it's over
The era damn
Leaves one more champions league so in most people
Sure sure without crazy come back in a
That was the first soccer game I ever watch so that's probably why like Liverpool
Yeah that was a been a great first came to watch
So that
Anybody's probably if those anybody's first saw him ever that's probably why the little sucker
Yeah
Russell if like if it's a tolled ordinance about the circle of really watch it every so every sun Saturday after that
It's a great it was a great game I only got to watch the highlights setting get to actually watch that game like the first game I remember watching was
Was our World Cup
Yeah two thousand six when's the damn
Six yeah yeah everybody remembers the the other each
I remember like being the was like seven yeah I was seven
Yeah no that makes sense to be disseminated should be one age one year
The
Yeah
Younger
I just seems a Davis
Yeah no
Straight into I'm just gets sent straight to the pen
Si
So
That was us
Another big vagalume at
Yeah
Like shock
Yeah I saw that I can't we will like I would anybody do that see I was seven I was like sports
Yeah
No one in your seven I don't think wants to have but anybody in sports I was like
If you surprise on I cut I code but within totally raft a lot ofgames that like it's really vicious
Really
Yes
I wanted to like try to rough it but I feel like the
The right
Parents would be
Then for the problem of sleep there's a lot of work
Yeah
To rough it was like you have to train them like it was nice to be it already soccer for so you if you know the rules but was
Yeah
Still the the that's like well the kids will get angry field make mistakes all the parents will come out for you like you made a mistake for like so that's fun
Yeah
Easy better
How much do you make for that type of thing
I was like
Twenty twenty five thirty dollars a game
that's pretty good
But they were like one hour games
Oh so yeah that's pretty good
or  yeah
Because like r high school refs I remember used to make like bank
when you were in high school or
OIR
yeah
yeah
when when no
Like uh
when I was in high school
So you are playing for the team and those those yeah
Yeah
Like the reps would make bank considering how long the game was but they'd show up five minutes before and then leave right after they got there paying they'd make like
oh my gosh
Fifty dollar an hour type of thing that's like
It's a very good pen her that however ever wondered how much like FIFA refs make
That is the question but I feel like
So it isn't a lot but it's a good amount
I feel like there's a really
Largest very like either do you get paid nothing
Yeah
F like know when his name there's like a few people everybody knows our name
Yeah
Like Howard what wo
Mark Clattenburg
Local Klan very like them probably get
Yeah
Yeah money close to some players
Damn
Hello more than like some players
Yeah
What are like the like the championship and like the league one early to rest me
What are like the other
Yeah
Only through that's the second job
How about a lot yeah
Over there
It's pretty great second job like in a life
Yeah
I wish I could do some like the D really cool but yeah
Na I'm probably I probably would not tolerate being shouted at by like three thousand fans or something I'd just be like stop
I don't think I'd have the fitness to be a professional soccer player in the first place so like
Yeah
Let alone a ref
I don't think many people do
Yeah
That's a incredibly high level of
Yeah but they always seem like bigger you know what I mean
Yeah
You know so I mean like some some people like can look big but like
Yeah
Yeah
Still
Are wicked fit
Yeah like ZaZa
ZaZa
OIR repeat
ZaZa is just a beast
He's huge
Or um
He's still injured right
I think so I think he
Oh so it's not even worth it oh that'sthat's s
Yeah
That's only one season yeah and that's a whole season long
Yeah
It's sad  too old
Wait when did he get injured
That was like mid oh maybe
Was like Europa league semi's
So that'sMarch April
Right yeah March April
repeat
I don't know might not be a full year then I don't know his injury was pretty nasty though
I don't remember
His like his knee went like that
Oh I love the
Yeah it's not it was
All
Same thing having the curtain the ana in a
So
Waka
When he was well over when he was loaned out or at Chelsea
At Chelsea like a
The season we got tenth when he was like are only good defender
Where
He just yeah then we pretty much sets at the end of the season
I love the
I love that
Such a brutal
Well any other interests that uh
I don't know do you like any other sports some pretty picks for so
Oh I watch a little bit of ask well here in there not a lot but
Celtics since you're here now or
uh the only games I really started to watch were the playoffs last season so I gotto watch them play the Calves I think it was
Mhm   I went to the last game that was fun
who'd they play
Calves like  I went to thelast game yeah
oh oh the playoff
Of the season the playoff yeah
it was it was very fun
Yeah
That that was my first basketball game so it was like just thrown into like like a really crazy situation on your first so
hm
Yeah
So like
It was just crazy atmosphere was intense
So much fun that was summer like I can do fun stuff like that in summer during the school year I have to be relatively
Yeah
Reserve like
Yeah
Reserved
You got work and stuff to do I feel yeah I want to get out to see a game eventually but
Yeah you should they're pretty cheap
How much are they
I mean the that playoff was like a hundred plus but like
Okay yeah
But like for  you can probably get there was one night that Tufts offered like five ti five dollar tickets plus ride
Five dollar
With public they go fat by fast so I would do that for this probably yeah I did that if I had the chance for your first sample of if you didn't fully Max thirty
There
I am not solid
Yeah
It's like cheaper than concert tickets Roger
Oh yeah both for
Damn
That's sweet
What other game like a do any do you have a special team in your heart that's just like I don't root for them but
Hm
Because I have a couple those in soccer and I've like
Like what
Like uh
I mean like yeah I can k I can see in the Primary League
I don't think there's anyone whose hard
Yeah
I feel like I I'd I could have a decide favorites in other leagues I like to sell to
Yeah
Even though I li my favorite team in that t in  would probably be Dortmund like a lot of people
I love watching Dortmund play
Yeah and then yea but if  played Dortmund I'd be like
Yeah
Well it's it's cool it's like a der it is aderby
Yeah
I it is
Oh I think so
I have no idea
I remember watching one
Year and they were like something derby
Hm
Yeah Mhm
I need I need to review it's fun to watch th
You don't know where they get it from
A even if they did don't I don't think we'd notice because like all the hype for for the game in the commentators a like the people in the fans
Yeah
Yeah
So like the hype alone will make this like like well this is so special
Yeah I love watching art type of stuff like spurs Chelsea amazing games
Man
Especially in recent years yeah
Man Manchester Darby is always great occasions
Mhm
uh what did we go to
oh Clasico when I can find like a random stream
Yeah
Never on any TV
It's on beIN Sport half the time
Yeah I never got beIN sport at home though which kinda sucks so I'd haveto just search around the internet
yeah  I've been doing that a lot now in college just becauseyou don't wanna have a TV but like
Yeah
It's just a s simple search on reddit usually gets you like a good five
Yeah
Streams
Soccer streams you use
I don't remember the name I search it up every time so like it probably is
Yeah my roommate like showed me soccer streams I saved my life
Soccer streams how do you spell it
Uh r slash soccer and then streams yeah
oh okay so so it's just streams
Yeah yeah
Just normal
Yeah
Okay I'm gonna see if
It's amazing
It's so amazing
Okay I'm gonna use that
They show methey show you how many ad overlays there are so you don't like click on anything
Occasionally you get one that just has none it would just plays it's so amazing
But
Yeah
Yeah you're gonna learn to take great advantage of that
Yeah
Do do you have a TV in your room then
Yeah we are an HDMI he is is the a puts computer on so nice
Certainly on the room I don't have a TV were really feel it that's too big of us an extra a distraction I could not control
Yeah
Well a lot of work
Yea
So I can understand that but
Yeah no it double enjoyed free time now
Yeah
Because starting at and then even on the semester depending on how you plan it like
Yeah
Like now you have to register for classes only got of the I wish I'd because like everything was like for this major take this this major date this and by then
Yeah
You're already at like five foot five credits
Did you have your major like decided by the time you
When I came I was like ninety five percent by a closer
Yeah
And then psychology just came after last semester ting of social psych and it's like
Yeah
Who only look into this and like I saw was relatively easy to like finish it like a I
Right now after next semester I know I only have to take five more classes for that major
Yeah
And then six more classes the other major so that's eleven classes over four semesters versus like which is not that much um did
Yeah
For for
No five five so that's sixteen over four semesters no it's going down
Yeah
To level all the for graduate and so it's a vehicle that's one open
Yeah
To survive this semester the system pre brutal
Yeah you get through this year based on the home stretch after awhile
Yeah what's a good crazy
Work terms
Down
How did you decide so early what you want no knew what you wanted to do
We
Yes this pre med came pretty easy to sleep through courses my mom dad's a doctor just like medical events in the family so like that I came pretty easy and like from there also to see what other majors related to a the bios to like
Broad consequence up to like a fit like that's like an easier siding chemistries like like a lot of really specifics for feel like bio chem is like it's definitely more chemistry than bio but like it introduces enough file just
That like I can still enjoy that aspect of bio that like that
Yeah good Max
I enjoy yeah exactly what's that mean um what more lean towards him to say like seventy chemistry and then thirty bio
That's like is like
There
Hello more fun for me
Yeah did you take psych wonder
I took with AP psych
Okay knew who you pass the credit so you don't have to
Yeah hello I mean I feel like it I like that better
Yeah
We could give to the credit unlike in high school I don't know why full of like an
I just memorize everything so well
Yeah
So like even last semester they'll be like a year removed from my school
I don't say that much because I still remembered everything
Down
So like it's still health like for chem those the same like the first semester was absolutely no mean yeah I study but like not as much some study now
Yeah
Cuz like this is like I feel like this semester is the first one let it was a completely new material
Yeah
This is last semester I suffer Arabic which I didn't know but up
The other two at least I have like the basis of something
Yeah
Before so like that's why
Gotcha hm
What inspired you to take Arabic
Arabic
so I'm from Egypt
Yeah
Gotcha
But I don't speak Arabic at all
Yeah
I I understand it pretty well so if uh someone speaking I'll reply in english but like
That's so that's about it then the that's about it Umm and do you said I liked our church on the do it I'll another places so this helps overall
Yeah
Yeah
Now in the know
Yeah
About math for you
Well now I
I took like my first hard math class I thing
All
Junior high school
What was the
Is basically like intro to a be
Oh intro to ab
Yeah which are my high school is kind of weird for they had like
Do
They tried to speed you along if they saw you were a little bit I took geometry honors or something freshman year and they said okay wellwe're gonna put you like in this weird
Sick
Uh
Algebra two class a little bit higher so you can go up to AB or something
Yeah I took BC in junior year
Yeah damn
Yeah I heard BC is mucheasier compared to calc two in college
It's
Much easier
Yeah like taking two in high school is easier compared to
Yeah no I feel like
Two here
Everything
I mean yeah
Yeah I mean speed kinda plays a factor too I'm sure that makes it harder justby
Exactly
Like
Being therebut
No I I w I really ex when I first came to college I really expected the speed to be a lot more of a factor you know I mean like
Yeah
Was like oh I have I have to learn all I did
in a year
I'm learning a year in like a few months but like in reality you don't learn that much
Yeah
Like
Yeah
Lake in the high if you to like chemistry for like the entire year and high school
Yeah
You probably gonna learn the same amount of stuff in like two semesters in chemistry like come one come to
Yeah
It's just gonna have to learn and this is in college Unisys a spin w hat the more time
Yeah
And like it's a single more depth political same this like the same units so this
Yeah
An extra few sections in the so like I was pretty happy
Gotcha
Because the like
I was worried about that the first time I came and I just I was shock ed how quickly I adopted I guess to how fast it would go
Uhuh
Me in my mid term for mass and really showed adaptation but yeah I'd how fast the things going so it's I was always interested in how about
Should be fine
Closely yeah I mean everybody's got to do it so yeah he's gonna find a way to
Did you pre um
Pre o
Sure so that's that's all that's the reason I got from a lot of people older freshman year
Yeah
The like the second reason is like
I just want to start with a friend group for the league of these that was the I was in a free a I did like the hiking one
Yeah
Were and like we to stay together until the end of the first semester I don't know if you see that still like a raise in the
Yeah
Well the pre um groups like stay together for a while and like no
Yeah
My roommate to he's still he did the exact same one you the the
Yeah two
Two
Yeah well I still sliding that's another group
Yeah
What do you know where you well wait where'd you lived on
Tilton
Tilton okay
What did you of freshmen
My freshman year living Haskell the now that's no longer
Yeah that's a sophomore Darla
It is very very nice they are single in the house go
Oh
And it was very nice so
I looked across at like the set up and it looks amazing
Yeah
Like the the sweet thing is that what is this like
Yes it's sweet so can you have
Practically the same number bathrooms
Oh
For floor
Yeah
Elites we and that's time you guys
Damn
Uhm make yeah two singles a double double double double
There isn't any of a big room whether now known Lewis wha
Oh whatever high service single which is nice but
Where is Lewis is it like right by
That's right next to
Right next okay
Do you know where the arts have you seen our craftsman you don't coxens
Yeah yeah
See to that building that you walk
Is it like Hodgins here and you just walk straight out and it's right over there
Yes from you he walked Audrey see the other building with a big grass in front of it that's Lewis
Yeah okay
If you walk straight out of the hardships for it up
Yeah okay
Yeah that's the
With the the weird like ridge thing that goes off to the road
Yea
Okay I was I always so got dropped off after club games like right there and I saw the bridge I was so curious like
It'll to just so
Who goes out there who goes out though I am interested
I go out there if from going home it's like a tough a rifle if like someone's going to help like
Yeah
It's easier
Yeah
That's the nice thing about it league here that's like the as of campus so I think this pick you up that way
Go straight on the road
There
Three so it yeah
Are you looking to live off campus next semester
That's that's a problem yeah no I got
I mean next next year
Oh that's the problem I don't know what I mean I also started fail eight so a lot of people have their things already
Yeah
Says there is stress also we didn't get our numbers from
Did you find out
Yeah
Our of the housing for housing and like last year because all drama has people with like really low numbers
Yeah
I wouldn't get the places they wanted
How do they determine who gets what lottery number
Also all random
I have a I am slightly inclined to say there
It could not be but
Umm
I don't now
There's always like theories and like stuff like that
Yeah
Conspiracy theories I mean they should change it
Now I get we can prove anything about it's Virginia messy but
Yeah yeah exactly Umm Lincoln's they one even though it people
I mean
Do it if they tried
Yeah
Yes the like I got a like the nineteenth Lois of like one thousand five hundred
Oh
Down
So I just like
He just got robbed basically
Yes so like any for my friends who've real had real numbers or like not on the phone number with you what is that that's the only thing that we created like
Yeah
Gives armor with people either they didn't like or check people that they like because of their number what's a hopefully they'll change
Could they do a good what how do they work that they take the lowest number and you to if you go together the low some
They take
Did they take average the together just so that
Oh average okay was
So that's why were it didn't work so like instantly like the the would be dismissed now they're trying to do like
Yeah
But again it's still gonna cause drama
Yeah
That's why I'm waiting to find out my number so like if it's real when I know that's not guaranteed then I'll have to work a lot harder in finding somewhere
Yeah
But if it's high then I'll just chill
Gotcha I mean I've heard a bunch of uh kids on the club team were looking for off campus their sophomore years I think and they said either go early or go really late because in the middle it was kind of a weird limbo situation
For what
For housing
Oh to search
Yeah the search
Mhm Yeah no I'd probably go pretty late then
Yeah
I mean why why bother about it now if it doesn't make any real difference
Exactly like
Yeah
People do really early just to get out of the way
Yeah
But like
What if you have other stuff to do
And also if they're going to work or stay in summer
Yeah
A lot of the le they can get the leases start either like August September or June
Yeah
Yeah
Because so if they started June like the whole like if classes end may tenth they'll have like a few weeks so find out what they're gonna do and then they can move into their house so like yeah
yeah
neat it's also feel find out real quick
yeah
I was definitely not the more and draw will part but it's still
that's like all logistical like waiting around what's my what's my future here
The employer I kinda hate that sensation of I can't do anything about it but like
When you can't do anything that source
Yeah
That's why I would like always email them so at least I would like I feel like I'm doing something
Yeah I feel
Like if you push alarm a funny was little do it everyone
Gotcha
So you will don't suggest someone single so one singles someone single
There's
And like I had like the lowest number just like nobody if I didn't do that and there's I'd probably be in a double so and like the basement of like I don't even know where
So like yet
Those who push it
Cool
Omg Hannah we're on camera
We are
oh my god
Wait over there
There's like monitors
He's a this is a mirror or a wall
It's a very clean air
I'm so scared this is going to go so bad
I feel like this is the haunted house
Over
black mirror

Really
Some people can get offended and like something that's what yo u're trying like

Also the like critique of there

Mom came to bail me out of jail
Mo came to bail you out
mhm That's so funny why are you folding your hands
I feel like I'm in a position of authority
very proper
anyway okay so yeah interrogation time
Okay so
mm
What cr what crime did you commit
Probably like
If you were to end up in jail
Smuggle too many guavas from the tea
S did I don't say literally my favorite fruit though did I
I've never had guava
you never oh yeah I think we talked about this
We definitely haven't
You have to have a guava like a nice juic
What is it
It's like
it's like this fruit and then has a bunch of seeds in the middle and it's just like so it's very sweet you do get constipated
So many like little seeds
huh Interesting
I think
I don't know yeah well anyways but it's really good
so if we ever go to the DR
To DR yeah
Thu sell them in New York too though like they have like um like these markets where we can buy them but they're small
hm
mm
They're like the nasty version
yeah but that's what would be your crime
mm
My crime
It would definitely be something like super weird and by accident
by accident
That's so funny and by accident like you didn't know it was
Yeah I didn't
I can see that
Like I didn't know it was illegal
then all the sudden I just like end up in jail
I can see that
and the FBI ends up at your house
Yeah
and like
That's funny
I feel like I work for NASA
With this
Yeah
Checking one two three
Have you ever seen um hidden figures
I haven't I know I have to I have to watch that I have to watch um fences
I haven't seen oh
We have to watch fences I need to watch Moonlight
Oh yeah that's the other one yeah
Is that is that right
yeah
like I kind of heard about it
yeah
And like I heard it's like really good
that's true yeah maybe I could write about hidden figures
That's true for the for the critical analysis right for
I'm still struggling to figure out what I want to write about
tick tock
Right I know
it's Gonna be
A
it's gonna be forty four fifty five on Friday and you're gonna be
you'll be like
Yeah
Um are you writing about black Klansman
No I'm gonna end up writing about coven American horror story
oh right right right you said that you said that you said that
Because they have so it you have you know how you have to talk talk about like two or three to four characters
Two to four yeah
so I'm gonna talk about Angela Bassett how she plays this like
mhm
amazing like witch voodoo queen
mhm
and then um you know the girl from precious you know the movie precious
alright well there's this girl from the movie precious
is she one of the like witches in training
Yeah yeah yeah she she you remember her yeah yeah
I r I r Yeah yeah
So her
mm
Interesting
I think it'll be really interesting today I'm gonna have to and today I'm t just gonna try to outline it
Yeah I wanna outline today so I've got to pick I've been like during class I was like brainstorming shows I could do
mm
I don't know
I like I'm debating if I wanna do a show or a movie
I think that like
I don't like I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to find a specific episode in
like within the show
Within the season
mhm
because like if I've I feel like if I focus on the whole season it's
yeah
Yeah yeah she said you're allowed to like look at it as a whole
Yeah yeah so I was I was thinking of doing that
mhm
Yeah I was like debating and you have ever heard of like on my block
I heard of it
Yeah
They casted like this like white girl to play like
Yeah it was like weird yeah
a Mex she didn't even how to speak Spanish
Yeah
and like
it was weird but like the show itself the writing was good the acting was eh but like it was interesting maybe I'll do that
What was it about
It's like it's just about like these kids living I think in LA and just like their lives and experiences
mm
I don't know it was It was entertaining like I enjoyed watching it
Yeah
But I'm so conflicted cause I wanna do dear white people but I feel like
it's too like there's not enough critics criticism but I could do there
ya know
I get that
Like it's very purposely a good representation
very purpose
Yeah
Yeah
like
that's very true
and like they're really doing their best there
Yeah
Yeah
so I'm like trying to think maybe if I could
Yeah
Pick something so I could be more critical
Yeah that's a good thing about like coven is that they touch on like they inadvertently touch on it cause obviously cause it's like oh witches and like that's not real but like they still touch on that divide
mhm
and it's very evident
and like they do
To a certain extent do a good job
mhm
you know like it I think r really do emph like  over emphasize on some things like the fact that like she owns a hair braiding
mm
like salon in like twenty sixteen whenever the show whenever the season came out
Yeah
you know like and I guess I don't know
mhm
I have to like more I like I have to really sit down and like think about it
honestly I might just do Brooklyn nine nine
You know
Like even though she used it as an example I just think it could be like really interesting
Jake Peralta character I know like we have the same initials and everything but like he's kind of annoying I saw the first episode and like
Yeah I know he he gets better
Yeah it's like the new girl my gosh she's so annoying too
Yeah but she he's not annoying in the same way that she's like he he's not annoying once you get used to him
she's always annoying
Yeah
she's always annoying
she just like constantly annoy
the way she talks with like her big eyes
Yeah but actually that gets less bad throughout the seasons but she's still annoying like you don't realize how annoying she used to be cause she's still annoying all the way through but when you rewatch you're like oh my god she was so annoying
She was so annoying
you just you just become accustomed to her
Like
Yeah like I still find her annoying even in like the last season but like the first she's like a whole different like level of annoying there
Really
Really
Yes she comes like bearable but like first season she was like beyond
No Way
mm
This is so weird cause I feel like it's a mirror but it's not
yeah it's not
Right isn't kinda like offputting
Yeah
It's so off putting right
Yeah I feel like it's like
like
I feel like you they can make it into a one way mirror maybe
Oh oh yeah probably that's interesting
I think so
I think we can do that but it's so off putting like when we first came in I was like
hm
I was like what are you in one room
I think one what is this
one of you in the other I was like oo
I know was you do you mean you're gonna be separate
why
what's about to happen
it's so driving what's going on
mm
that's so funny
So funny
I'm honestly so tired though
me too
so tired
And I'm hungry
we could get food after this
I know it's gonna be like dinner time
We can go to carm
oh
What if carm poisons me no no no hold on
What do you mean what if carm poisons you
No did it didn't I tell you
in Rody and rom um um the n the night we performed one of our girls like got poisoned from carm and literally like she was projectile vomiting everywhere
Okay well that does not happen to anyone else
I happened to Amanda
Okay or else they would be shut down
they can eat I would I would like sue them
Yeah
So naturally I sue
So naturally I sue you
So um nope we shoul go to Carm
why
It's so close
Yeah we can just go
well Now you got it in my head I'm gonna be poisoned
well
No I've eaten there before like yesterday I ate I
I don't trust
So are you not going t out tonight are you gonna stay in
Yeah
that's what I'm thinking
I wanted to go though not gonna lie like Jasmine mean told me
ew
Yeah
eh
mhm
I don't like him
I know yeah I know you don't like him
just because yeah I definitely get that
like
I just don't vibe with him
Yeah
he's Very I don't know
He's he's so like stereotypical
Yes okay yeah thank you that's what I was thinking about
He's such a stereotypical athlete boy
he's
like
No white boy
Yeah but like but like white athlete just like the most
You think he's an athlete like you think he's like he like
He act acts like an athlete the w like his
You think so
His like demeanor and his mannerisms
Yeah
I just feel like he's always high
That's true he's just like super weird I thought he was from Colorado
He is
he is oh right I get confused between him and TJ I know one of them's from New Jersey
and one of them's for colorado
I don't know TJ
yeah I think they look alike him and Conrad
Other it doesn't matter that I've ever seen
I honestly don't think it's like
I don't think it matters
It doesn't matter
Um
Ten years from now you're like back the they're doing a psych study
hm Conrad
That one time that one person
Yeah
I don't know
Overall I think they they're great people
they're great overall
um but no but I get that
Like when he came like I don't know I just don't like that he doesn't make any effort to be friends with anyone besides
I see that
Like when we
But a lot of guys are like that
True
Like a lot of guys like unless they're like easy going like
Yeah
just like chill guys they're not going to make an effort to like
I don't know to like to really be friends with their friends
Yeah
Like from miles like for example
He's a chill guy
and like he was like friends with me when they were together but like
Yeah
You know it's like eh
Yeah
mhm
Yeah
for
We should have thought of like code names before
I honestly I don't think it matters
Yeah I don't think it matters I kept trying to read your shirt
Oh it says Hey are you even real
Did you make those goals
No
or it a come with them
It can like that
Is it from urban outfitters
No it's from Zara
ah
Yeah
I've been to Zara once
What did you think
It was nice I didn't get anything cause we were kind of in a rush
I love Zara
yeah
it's like sometimes it's like over priced
Yeah we went to the sale section
Yeah that's what I my mom and I always new we always go first we always go to the sale section
Yeah
and like see if we like anything
Yeah
And then we check out the rest the stuff
And we were on the upper east side too so it was like
yeah
Yeah
upper east side
Yeah
I mean it's like a nice neighborhood obviously but like I don't know it just has so many like
It just makes me think of Gossip Girl
Not even like there not even na there's just so many like
I don't even watch gossip girl
There's so much history and like just segregation tied to it that I don't talking about segregation for my
talking about segregation speaking of
for my sosch class um there's just so much about tied to it that I'm like
mm
you know
Yeah
Just like put off by it
Yeah
The area I was in was cool
Oh yeah no it it is it's it is a cool area
Easily startled
um it is a cool area but like
uh huh
Yeah I don't know
Yeah that's nice
I wouldn't want to like live there
Oh no me neither but they're like it was just like they had a lot of cool like stores and stuff
not even stores just like food places
Oh yeah
Yeah I mean that's New York in general
Yeah true
In my city
I li I love New York so much obviously
mm
like l like being outside of it makes me like love it more
Yeah yeah
j at least appreciate it more
Yeah that makes sense
at Wait there was this diner I went to in Brooklyn it was a vegan diner
there's so many vegan diners in brooklyn
Really I'm trying to think like that was like the first
Yeah
do you remember the name
No but it was really good and it was like one of the first times I've ever been to Brooklyn
I I don't really spend much time in Brooklyn
In Brooklyn
Yeah
well yeah
People
A lot of my f
My phone just rang
A lot of my friends parents are from Brooklyn
really
That white flight to the suburbs
Yeah
mm Literally
the white flight to the suburbs
That what that's what it is
oh my god that's so true though
Yeah
Honestly that's what I was thinking the other day like when I grow up like when I'm like not grow up but like when I grow older
mhm
do I wanna like where do I wanna live
Yeah I was thinking about that too actually today in class like
Really
I wanna make a conscious
Oh after the segregation talk
Yeah like a conscious decision of like where I live
Same
cause
I feel like it's so easy to be like oh I wanna live in this area and e you know like
Yeah because
Talking about that mobility that we were talking about
Like a lot more goes into it because a lot of they're like my town is like predominately white but at this like like what attracts people there is the like really high quality public education
So it's like a combination of because it's well funded it has this great education system which attracts more people to it so it's like I don't wanna live there is like I just don't wanna live in the town I grew up in like I just does not feel to me
Yeah I said
But um like that's like a lot of people move back that lived there
Yeah
To go back for the education system
Yeah
and also it really depends on your job
mhm
like
Yeah for what I wanna do living in the suburbs like just doesn't
Yeah
Seem like It would fit into my career path
Yeah
Same either
but that's what I'm saying like even at that point when you're like retired
mhm
like where do you wanna go like that's what I was thinking
Who knows what the world will look like by then
I was like
Stop
I was talking
oh my god stop it isn't even time
I was talking to Lindsey and she was saying how she doesn't want have kids cause she's scared of like the world they're gonna have to live in
Oh my you know yeah when we were playing um
Cards against humanity
yeah
she brought that up
yeah
We were talking about it and she was talking about like that article about climate change the New York Time put out like by twenty forty like it was be like real massive effects um so she like I want kids like in theory but I don't actually wanna have kids cause I don't want to like put them into like that
mm Yeah
Which is kind of crazy to think that
It it kinda crazy
I don't know if I want kids
Right now I don't either honestly
I mean obviously I know I'm too young to like actually make that decision cause I'm like no where near that point in my life
I know I haven't even experienced what real love is
Yeah exactly how long
What a me I like
Yeah
Family love but not like romantic love
No I know what you mean
but like also like parts like I feel like I need to just cause I've been conditioned to think like that but also part of me is like
Oh you mean like you've been yeah yeah
Why
yeah
How you've grown up you feel like you have to I mean yeah
Like even like
Again the way society brings us up
in elementary school we were like what do you wanna name your kids like that was a topic
I actually yeah I already have my my boys names set and that's
Exactly people already
I hate that like that so it's so annoying
What what are the names
So Sebastian Blaine I know I know I know but I really like the name it's such a like elegant name
Yeah I like the nicknames
When it's not attached to certain people
No but I'm talking about like the
like yeah said it's it's a cute name yeah I know but um Sebastian Blane and and Damien Avery
Interesting
And I want them to have middle names cause I don't have a middle
You don't have a middle name
No I don't so like
You know middle names are like so
Yeah
Yeah
I ha I
Nice
I like the name Martina
Martina Martina
Because
cause I have a friend named Martina
mhm
well we're not like close anymore but like we like I don't know she was just like
Amazing and um I've always loved that name ever since
In honor of her
I also like the name Tessa because of the book
Tessa's a nice name
oh my god stop if that book wait of a book what book
you wouldn't it's like uh the infernal devices
oh no forget it
What were you thinking
Well first of all divergent oh no her name is Tess in divergent
Have you not read divergent
her
I have but I don't remember her name being tess the main
Yeah
oh tres LOL well there's like another book
Not well it actually it's published now but it used to be like a fanfiction thing
uhuh
and her and the girls name was te tessa
oh Yeah I like the name tessa
Tess is a nice name
Yes it's a nice I don't know there's like a lot of names I like
I als the reason why I like se it
Gabby Gabby
the only reason why I like seb too is like it sounds really good in Spanish
Yeah like Sebas
Yeah Sebastian
Yeah
Damien doesn't sound that good demi da
I don't even know how to pronounce it
Yeah I'll something that like I probably will have to do is name my kids after like my relatives like
Why
That's like very very cultural for Jewish people like my name is Rachel because my
had a great grandma or great great gramma was Rachel and my middle name is Sophia because my mom's great grandma was Sophia and that's the same way for my sister's Alexandra like Samantha it's like
Yeah that makes sense
All the names everyone's names are based off of
Yeah
Your relatives
That's so interesting
Yeah but I mean you can do it like very specifically
so your dad was Jewish is Jewish
mhm
so your mom had to convert
no my mom was Jewish too is ha is Jewish
Really
Yeah
Her Argentinan family Argentan family
Is Jewish
there's actually like a decent
oh I didn't know that
Decent Jewish population in Argentina cause a lot of
I didn't know that
Jews fled Eastern Europe to Argentina in the late eighteen hundreds
That's like a pretty far
Yeah it's a weird also Argentina's also connected with a lot of Nazis fled there
uh huh
After the war
After World War two a lot of Nazis fled to
Argentina
that why they ha that's why they have those rooted like very prejudiced views on certain things
Yeah
Yeah which is interesting because like my family went to Argentina in the late eighteen hundreds so
Just I yeah I was talking about Argentina like certain Arg Argentine people
oh yeah it's very like
and like just the way they yeah it's
Europeanized
Yeah and they have certain like prejudices
mhm
Yeah they do
Which is really interesting
Yeah I was reading an article how like it's gotten less prejudiced
maybe we're like the rest of Latin America
Yeah
It is very white
right
it is
yeah
Is has a very small population of like
Yeah
People of color
Yeah a lot of it is just like Very mixed
I haven't met an origin
like very diluted
diluted
Like if you look at the soccer team
mm
Obviously I do um like I would say like at least a good handful of them like look like they have indigenous roots
Oh indigenous roots
mhm
um
Yeah
but like if you look at Messi like no but like some of the other ones like really do look like
That
Native
Yeah native
native so like yeah that makes sense
Yeah so it's a lot like  I think like the government is super white and they perpetuate like the whiteness
oh a one hundred percent
So like there actually is like a decent population of indigenous people and like mixed people but they get like obscured by the government and are kind of like left out of it
When do the indigenous people not get ups like where
No true
like
yeah they're just like not as visible so people like perceive it as like is the super white country
Yeah
yeah
which like it is but also has a significant non white population that's just kind of hidden
mhm
Because they want to present this image as like the Europeanized Latin American country
Yeah
that's wild
Yeah
I really didn't know much about Argentina until like I made friends with like
Yeah
like my Italian friend
Yeah it's really interesting
mhm
I also don't know all of it because
Yeah I mean
Like my mom has told me a lot of stuff but I still know
mm
like no don't talk about it here I don't want them to get scared
wow
that they haven't told me even though they've told me a lot
So
That's wild
Yeah I want to learn more about it
Yeah even when I like when I s like said on talk to them about like why we left Tiar
mhm
like it
Yeah like there's so many stuff there's so much stuff that when I was like younger I guess like
Yeah
I like just didn't know
Yeah
You know
Yeah
And like when we sat down and like she told me like like a lot of like the whole story basically like
mhm
a lot of things made sense a lot of s things still like didn't
mhm
but in the way I just like if like there's like some clarity to everything
yeah like I when I was younger they just
There's like a purpose No Way
Yeah they just hold it let us like um we left for like economic opportunity and like that was like the story we heard
Very generic like American dream yeah
that
Yeah as I got older since like on a military dictatorship
Easter Easter via
that's what
And like everyone was disappearing
Yeah
Yeah
That's why
Yeah
So like I don't know as I've gotten older I've learned more about like what happened
Yeah
I didn't does your mom still have family in Argentina
Yeah we still have not immediate family but like cousins and like family friends and like
mm
people that are just like considered family even if they're not like my grandparents like never wanted to come here and don't like it they don't not like it here but they like didn't want to assimilate are not
they were like miss being there
Yeah
So they never really made new friends here so all of their friends are back in Argentina like they didn't want
Do they go often
When they were younger they did now there like too old also it's like expensive
Yeah
on
Any part of like Latin America's so expensive
Yeah
The like they didn't like just like the culture here and the atmosphere is it's very cold
I mean
so they like
Yeah
Their friends are still there and like they still talk to them all the time
mhm
which is gotten easier with facetime it's so funny
That's so cute
It's so funny watching them facetime their friends they're like
oh my god
we can see you it's hilarious
It's the cutest thing
Yeah so it's it's super interesting
The heart
mu heart
Yeah so
It's actually so cute
Yeah
Oh yeah I know like for us we have a lot of like my mom and I have a lot of family there
Yeah because my grandpa like my willow has like eight or nine siblings so we just have so many cousins there just like
Yeah
I remember once when we went
yeah my mom is like one of twelve
Yeah like I remember when we went um
What's it called we went to like dinner with  or like lunch with all my like grandpa's cousins
mhm
and like it took up the we couldn't it was the entire restaurant like is was like more than one table like it was like everyone there like fifty
like it was insane like I'd never seen anything like it in my life like
big mood
I don't I didn't even get to meet all of them that's how many there or like
That's awesome
like I was like who are all these people
Who are these people
And he was like how these are your relatives and I'm like no way that's not right
where did they come from
exactly so
This is so funny
um
you know what I was thinking about too the other day I was talk I was thinking about remember when we were learning like first generation second generation third generation
mhm
ond like one point five
Yeah
I was thinking about like technically I am fi like first gen right in that way
It would be one point five
One point five cause I grew up here right
but I wasn't born here
cause you came here as a kid
mhm
or a teenager
Yeah because I grew up here yeah
Yeah
As a kid so like I was thinking about how like normally
mhm
native born
Yeah
And then you have like third generation and all that
Yeah
And like by th by second generation you have kind of like a in
Yeah
oh
I can like hear my voice
Same it's so weird
So weird
can you hear like
oh my god
like the little white noise like
We think the little feedback
oh my god this is so weird I feel like like
like low key I feel like I'm looking into a mirror right now
which is like really really freaking me out
It does look could give me a
Literally the same

Yeah
&Laughs that's like where I at a table
Oh
But I wonder what the point of shooting us through like glasses like what's the point of the glass
I don't know yeah why not just have us be in one room
Maybe for like microphone quality

Dangerous
But it may not
Okay s so
This is weird
Yep
It's like a two way mirror but only a one way mirror Or
Yeah
Or all way mirror I don't know not really mirror
Or is mirror the reality
question mark
Isn't it by definition a reflection of reality
Whatever you whatever you think man
If you could see through it would it would just be a no way mirror right a zero way mirror
I guess yeah
Or a one
Are one way mirrors the one that you can see through
A from one side but not the other side
This is an existential conversation we're having
Yeah I feel like it probably would cause a twoway mirror would be reflective on both sides and you wouldn't be able to see much through it
astute
Astute sir
This room is weird I feel like I'm in a padded room
I feel like you're in front of a green screen and I should be seeing like some kind of like
Like some nice visuals in the back
Interesting background
yeah there personal question for you if you could be in front of any green screen background what would it be
I quite like the green in the background green's my favorite color I think I' m just happy with this
Man of simplicity
What would you
wow
Would you prefer to be in front of fake backgrounds
well see
Neon green disturbs me
We can't be friends then
Fine that's fine I don't
Neon green is like the third best green
No
Yeah absolutely
Muted colors are always the most elegant what are you talking about
Muted colors like
What what's a muted what would youeven consider a muted color
Like
like forest green is an acceptable green because it's not like in your face you know it's like a polite green that asks you how are you and doesn't like punch you in the face like neon green does
On one hand I agree because forest green is obviously the best green
Of course you agree because I'm always right
I I would say it's more that forest green is just the best green
Neon green sucks
That being said that being said
neon green is one of the best greens but it's not the best but it's it's close
No you're wrong
You're wrong
The tree wait do you have a tree too
Yes I think so if you count tha yeah that's a tree
Yeah we have like mirror rooms kinda weird there's even a weird yellow paper in the bottom corner on both
Interesting
Oh I think they meant for it to be like this to seem like um okay
It's like a mirror except for it's you and not me in the mirror
Yup
That's weird
It's kinda like you're talking to yourself but you're hallucinating it's me
e
Mhm
I like the the green uh on the leaves though is like the best green
Very observant What kind of shade is that what would you call that
Leaf green
Very descriptive as well
You should you should be an artist like you're just the creativity is just like oozing today
Yeah
You know when you're stuck in a in a large pad box it's hard to be creative
I yeah I can understand the pain
This is crazy are you going to Winter Ball tonight
I don't know I was thinking about it why
I am also thinking about it but I probably
I don't think I'm gonna go
Yeah I mean
Because it's ten dollars and that's a lot of dollars but on the other hand like
Typical student huh
Yeah but like on the other hand like it's an experience and like you shouldn't miss out on experiences if you have the choice I feel like
That's true
but then some experiences are better than others and I don't know a the quality of this experience because I've heard that it's less of a dance and more of a concert and that doesn't sound very
Enticing
Appealing
Yeah I feel that
Dancing is fun though
I can't say I feel that
We'll convert you there's everyone can dance I don't like pe people who are like oh I can't d everyone can dance
I can't dance
Yes you can
I can't I can't dance
Okay
Well
Next time there's a party we'll fix this
Okay I can dance I can dance but I can't dance well like at all
Baloney please
Although you made a good point like it might be an experience but it's not necessarily the best experience for my night
There we go you know what's a better experience dancing
Yeah but dancing will be included in that experience so I feel like
No Concert dancing is different that's like swaying and being boring that's not
Yeah
That's not dancing
It doesn't count
I can't dance then
Then I we'll fix it that's fine
What if I'm allergic
You can't be allergic to dancing what
I know a girl who is allergic to fluorescent lights
Okay well you're not allergic to dancing
Yeah so
and if you have an allergic reaction I will take you to the hospital so it's on me
yeah I'm
Yeah I'll blame you
Okay
If you killed me
that's fine
Poison me
I'll
Y
m muahaha
whatever the aller what would you call it if you give someone what they're allergic to is it poisoning  yeah probably not poisoning
What would we call that reaction hyper motor ptosis
Hyper motor ptosis
Boom
I like the pto
Thank you
That's the best part of it the pto
I'm allergic to mold and I never know whether I should put that down when it says are you allergic to food or not cause like there's mold in food like I can't eat Pirate's Booty
I do but I I can't
Really
I shouldn't
You you rebel wow
Yeah I get hives it's bad
It's my body telling me not to do it
it's like um in The Office they were like there is like an episode where they asked them to put down their diseases so they c they can be covered by insurance and the receptionist is like um I wanna make up fake diseases she's like she's like what would you call that if my teeth turn to liquid and then drip down the bottom of my throat and the guy's like um that's real that's hydrodentroplosion and she's like
astute
Wait that's real no that's not real yeah yeah no shot that's real no shot that's real
No it's not real
Course it's not real
In context it could have been real but
Someone you don't know everything Everything can be real
Yeah I Yeah I'd
Well I mean I'm pretty sure that like your teeth can't just liquify but like other than that
What do you know You're not a doctor
You have you have no knowledge the world
Yeah you're right
you're right
I know
That's a good point
as always
I'm on a roll today
As always
my dad always used to say
I I I'm always right except for the one time I thought I was wrong but I was actually right
I know! Oh my god I remember that quote I don't know where I saw that too but it was from somewhere
Yeah My dad definitely didn't make that up so we got it from somewhere for sure
Like a book or something
Yeah
But like you know you can never trace dad wisdom
My dad likes reciting quotes too but up until the age of probably fifteen I just wholeheartedly believed that he made all of those up and then I was gravely disappointed
Yeah the first time that you see a dad joke elsewhere like not from your dad you're just like I've been cheated
I've been lied to
It's
it's interesting cause I mean Russian dads are different they're they don't make dad jokes they're like
Melancholy and at times very serious but
Russian dads
They have their moments
I've never met a Russian dad or like a Russian person
I know it's it's an ex well hi but it's an experience
hi
Yeah it's interesting
I think there are probably
There are probably like
Maybe three or four like
Like primarily Russian in descent families from like my town
there's so few
Russian in descent
Yeah like Ru like you know like Russian
Mhm
you know
gotcha yeah it's actually Boston's a pretty popular town for Russians Boston Long Island
I don't live in Boston though I live in the white suburbs
Whatever
The all white suburbs like ninety eight point two percent white  like ac you think I'm kidding but like actually my friend I have I have a friend who's Filipino and he has like five people in his family and we were just looking on like the wikipedia page one day for Danvers and we were just like oh it looks like there's a like a point one percent Filipino population and then we like we're like oh let's just do the math and it turned out there are like eight Filipino people in Danvers
Amazing
And that they're like family of five is five of them which is hilarious And I I'm pretty sure they've since moved so like
They were like
Other and then there were three yeah
But yeah
did you know that the Russians made their own version of Winnie the Pooh and it's terrifying and I was really scared of it
I didn't know they d did that but I'm not surprised it's terrifying
have to show it to you because it's really scary
I I was afraid of it when I was little
Is it like
Had a love hate relationship
Wait is it like still Winnie the Pooh but
It's like their own their own version of Winnie the Pooh like a cartoo like it's their cartoon but it
Is it still uh a pooh
It is a bear but it's
A pooh
It's
A pooh
yes
Yeah
It is definitely a pooh
Winnie the Pooh
But yes
But not Winnie but not Winnie
But
well actually it's Vinnie Pooh but
So that's like the same though
But
It's kind of the same but then like okay he's not yellow and he doesn't have that cute red little tshirt no he's like this dark round thing with like white eyes and little pupils uh it's scary
Yeah
He he also does a lot of He does a lot of intres
Is it like a raccoon
He kind yeah kinda And he uses a lotta he does a lot introspection because
hashtag Russian  He does a lot of thinking
Yeah those Russians and their thinking
Yeah too much too much thinking
And their inexhaustible manpower that's all they have
Yeah
Their thinking and their millions of people who they're willing to throw at problems
Yes
Until the problem is solved
Indeed
Russia
Accurate not even wrong
That's historically Russia yeah
I mean my parents are Jews and Russia doesn't like those so
Yeah so that's
My parents were like we out
Yeah
Goodbye
Understandable
Yeah
My grandmother um lived in Germany until she was like like she literally grew up and was born in Germany and like took English as like a second language in high school and it was like a joke
Wow
But um
and then she was like twenty two and my grandfather was in the air force and like came over stationed in lik
Aw
Germany from the US and they like met
And like
had kids and they came back here
What a story
what a story
Yeah that shit's crazy though like
She didn't even know English she barely knew English and I'm pretty sure my grandfather barely knew German
Aw
Probably
so like they just kinda met and were like oh Hey
That's so cool
And they just like were married for like
Like a lot of years
They got married
People do that
Yeah crazy
yup
she just like came over
My parents my parents um they knew each other in elementary school in Kiev and then my mom tells me that her ten year old self was like Alex I like that one
I'm gonna marry that one
He's the one
when she was ten she was like
Damn
We we a thing and then they didn't like my dad moved to another school 'cause he wanted to do some math stuff and my grandparents moved him to another school and they didn't see each other for awhile and then they when they were in their thirties they met at a violin concert here in the US and my mom came up to my dad and was like hey you do you remember me I went to elementary school with you  and apparently he turned a shade of crimson and said no no I don't remember you and that's the story
that's crazy
What happened a year later two years later
That's crazy
yeah
That's so
Also our group our grandparent like are my two grandfathers actually knew each other before that because they went to school together
Wow
He is
I was a real like a small like
Small yeah yeah
Yeah
So
I don't think you have any cool stores like that
I'm just cooler than you I'm sorry
Yeah like evidently
I I know it's yeah I know it's a di sappointment but yeah
I was your family as
Now you know
No Verne
That wasn't even a shot that was he was shot
burn shots fi But I I'm so offended I don't even
I don't even know how to
I'm having too many feelings
If you go to take a break and um crash
yeah
I would feel but no I wouldn't feel but I mean it's all it that well that i t wasn't even meant that way at all
you wouldn't even feel ba
Do you feel while
Well I mean if you're crying out I have likea
Good an ice cold heart
Could just
There's like a baseline of like sadness like empathy maybe but
Well
I don't think it's
deserves so
Empathy is very important and it's a defining factor in emotional intelligence did you know that
last night we were watching planet earth and there were these turtles
Like I can't comprehend intuition
What do you mean
Like
in general
Yeah because like
It's like a sixth sense it's just a feeling you get
Yeah but where does that come from
Lives you know
How how does like a
I think we I feel like we develop it because we learn a lot about social interactions and we kind of pick um
Yeah but how do like baby turtles know to go towards the light
Well they're biologically programmed I would think there's certain cells in t he brain
But what is the biological programming like this is where I'm confu sed
What we come we're kind of talking about that in psych nine a little b it like the brain like brain plasticity and how like the brain adapts to certain situations I guess
the one lost
throughout the evolution
But
but it's saying that it can become like pre that they can come for it out did
Yeah
That's crazy
A lot of animal do that we're some of the only
So should not be like evidence for like physical
Like
Like there's a physical
Part of like memory
Yeah yeah the brain is constantly like reconfiguring itself throughout the evolution of the species like I feel like we're the only ones that have to develop like after were born like a lot of animals just come pre programm ed already but some
Yeah but I feel like I like all animals word
Thanks
I don't think learning is outside of the room
No no they demonstrate learning but I feel like we are the only ones t hat are were born the most help I mean if you think about it like  a baby zebra or something will start walking within like a day to and we're like just vegetated dental work
Yeah
Two and a half so
I guess I guess animals are like
Protected by their mothers are much more hopeless
general I I guess I w ould agree with that
yeah that's true where were very spoiled species
Because like animals like out I was just thinking like if you're born alone you how to out of your eco alone you just know
But you need to go towards the water not in the full moon and stuff like that like
Yeah that's true
Although some animals were demonstrated to sh demonstrate um they show altruism so like if their kid is in some kind of danger they will sacrifice themse lves finals do that
Yeah I feel like altruism is like a pretty explainable
thing
Yeah
Are I'm like
like an imprinting and stuff like that
yeah definitely I don't like I must not fully understand the like
The controversy around um
Whatever just talking about which I have forgotten
Intuition altruism imprinting
Altruism
altruism
Okay
I feel like I don't understand the controversy around alters my feel like it's pretty explainable like flick fitness Street
I guess yeah I mean I don't know it's kind of like if you are on the team of survival of the fittest then it's kinda strange that a fit mother would for example sacrifice herself to protect her sickly child like that seems kind of counter intuitive but then
I think sickly it might be a defining characteristic which would make altruism not really as important
I I think I feel like altruism makes sense a lot if you View the goal as passing on your genes
Why what do you mean
if your kids are like
Meaning if the kids are healthy and they're being in
If you're yeah so it's in your best interest to keep your it's much easier to keep a kid healthy than it is to literally become pregnant and then like have the kid again
okay
Gotcha
Okay
So it's like within your it's in your best interest to keep alive I feel like I
I'll give to
That's true that makes sense
I don't know maybe it's too like utilitarian
Like it to
Where to look at it I don't know
At the end world is brutal I mean there's no democracy over there it's just like you sick by
Right
see ya
Yeah like that's
So no health care for the animals
It
it's so human to like project and like after more five s tuff
Yeah for sure
And just like
give it like No personify things but
Yeah
In reality like things don't care there's no mercy is no empathy like
Nope
My role I mean I we were learning a lot about that and psych twenty last s emester about um self reference insult generation and things like you're more l ikely to remember things anymore like a to understand things if you do them your self and you somehow
mhm
human beings have the tendency to
Really things
Focus on themselves look at
Yeah
yeah
Sure
A service crazy
Yeah
I love psychology so much I'm so excited

Okay alright
In it's simplicity it's like the single best piece of writing I've ever read
Really

Okay will do

Like the look
Michael Michael
The most opposite trash could be
Okay then I will read it
is the highest
Not trash
it's good
Okay what else what read I read the sun also rises by Hemingway that was a very interesting book that was very strange because having way is like
Up a man of war and
Little words yeah he's I don't I can't relate to him at all of the aut hors like can't understand his books
Other fun things
yeah he's I don't I can't relate to him as an author so I can't understand his books
Most of his books are just male characters sitting around drinking  and talking about life and its many
House of the college
Many player
Sounds like college
To a certain extent I guess but there's also there's always a man who loves a woman but it's complicated because she is whatever whatever so
Yeah I think that's
Awkward
How dare you that's
My mom called me
Cool
Awkward I talked to this morning I don't know which cold before
I feel that I feel that my parents are very attention seeking
if I don't g ive it to them they keep calling Until I pick up yeah
Really
I think I'm lucky in that oh I would turn sister so she does all the calling to my parents you called like
Family child
Daily so
I'm the focus of it'll it'll
oh yes let
Out a lot
Verges on me
I mean
It's the opposite for me a
Yeah and plus is a cultural thing I mean Russians are involved in each other's lives to a to an extent that Americans find
Yeah
Invasive
Invasive
yes
so
My roommate's mom is just like
Really
On him all the time it's awful
N No way
It's so and he was my roommate last year
I never would have thought
It's like I feel bad for the kids so much like so often
True
It depends how you think about it I mean sometimes it's not it's not
Like sh she loves and wants the best for him so like I'm not
Yeah
I'm not you know like I can't like
See I'm glad you feel that because so many people who complain to me about it they're like ugh they're so annoying I'm like well you should be appreciative
hate her but
No like you have too understand she just wants the best for him but like what she thinks is best of him is just
Yeah
Not best for him because he is really bad at it
Not best for him
yeah he's really bad at it so
Oh wait is the person you were telling me that was doing comp sci but wants to switch because
Yeah because he didn't like comp sci so like
Okay
She sh Okay yeah it it's like there's a line like
That's
If she pushes him to go do comp sci that's not fair
I mean it's one thing to like care about your child and want the best for them and all that but you can't force them into things that don't make them happy
it's I mean
Yeah
Well you can
Well
And that's the problem
You shouldn't you shouldn't
you shouldn't
Yeah
Yes I agree
um
I mean my dad being from a math background definitely was like when I said psychology he was like you sure like you like not I feel that b ut then I switched to cog sci and that was a little bit more stem oriented see is like I can can you know
Neither of my pop
be comfortable with that
Not of my parents like went to college or anythin
my dad just like run his own company that my mom like
Oh really
Oh cool
Hopes Ron and don there's like construction so it's like actually like a big deal like a lot of work bottom
Yes another one called the like there they were like really excited when I was l ike yeah I'm going for bio and like biotech like I want to do genetic engineering and stuff
F zero Smarty pants of your family
Well relative to my sister relative to my sister yeah like a lot but um
Like I just decided uh like last semester I didn't want to do that anymore I wanted to do psych and they were like
psych ooo
Oh so you're a recent psych convert
Yeah
Okay
I converted
Gotcha
Uh
I have I applaud you Sir
Yes in
Good choice
Recently so here we are we'll see if it sticks I think ill s tick but we'll see
good cho
mm
I mean you see really incident like I am
Yeah
My friends are like a freight dimensions like near me because I'll get so excited I'm like you talking mother like okay Michelle like we got it okay you're like all those we got it
Yeah
a lot of my a
Yeah
Well the kids my suite like will of like like just discussions about stuff and whatever comes back like psychology always like get super excited and just like
You feel me
It's in my
uh
I was one of the find someone to talk about psych with because so sudd enly it sucks I have no like
My error of interest
What they live with I live with like two other psych majors so
What we got it
Oh oh cool
That's cool book
One of my suite mates next year gonna be psych majors
We're not doing the same stuff
they're all very very stubborn people one person public health of the other ones like comp sci comes like
Comp sci is just how for living with conflict people can be miserable I live with like for
Well I know them well enough
Yeah but like I live with four counts of people just thirty hours a week all the talk was comp sci there's like
sitting in the common room said in the room
Yeah but I have to do comp sci two to some extent for
Yeah but you have to do comp fifteen but not caught third not come for ty
Well I am thinking about minoring in comp sci actually
Even then it still only called fifteen of pressure
Really
I don't think you have to call forty for me
Oh
Minor
Okay
As well my friend is doing that as well bottom
Yeah like that's all the talk about which frustrated only about that twenty four seven just
I feel that
Like just things that like don't even mean anything to me
I feel that
I took comp eleven and it was like fun and like I did well in it and I had a background in it already so like it was pretty easy but
mhm
Oh ddid you do like programming before
I've had enough
Yeah I had like a little like
That
Just personal experience like I was bored just screwing around and um
Oh c
Oh y oh you just
Taught myself a little bit
born knowing comp comp sci oh
whatever
Nice
No it's not it's not intuitive
that's cool
mhm
it's definitely not intuitive  but um yeah
mhm
Yeah I am still have yet to do all that come stuff and it's makes me quite nervo us because I don't I have no experience
Yeah when you're gonna
At all
I mean
I wouldn't declare a comp sci minor or anything like that until you've done comp
Although I I d I do know some comes I jokes like Hey you're boolean me so mean
boolean
False
Equals equals
Or true
Equals equals true because you're mean to me
Equals equals
Yeah there's like I remember the equals equals there's equals equals equals and then like
Not equal to which is exclamation point a cool this is all is just a lot l ike I don't know it's all syntax
You're just scaring me now
I really don't like language
I love language I love languages but I hate late learning it
Like actual language but not
like I does don't at all want to be involved in learning them I just think they're cool u p like
that too
Well language are you taking for your credits
I took Latin three semesters
Oh that's really cool
It was like six does is like a fifteen person class wit h like a super like the best professor
Do you like it
Can you like create a new Harry potter spellers
No but like it's actually pretty sick like being able to read
That's really cool
Um
like I'm I did a what I did very little of the translati on homework but like some kids I know like are actually fluent in Latin it 's crazy
Supposed to do your homework Sir it's not very studious
It wasn't created
So no interactive
Yeah I still have to take my friend culture class it'll be done they almost my credits from high school
Lucky
I really should a taken that Russian placement exam that would probabl y make things easier for pre
If you would well you can in order place out of language yo u can do to languages to twelve like a three class level
mhm
or you could do o ne language to like anywhere from three to six and then like culture class and stuff
Gotcha
But if you'd place into like Russian for and French for you woul d have been completed on with your requirement
Yeah I mean the thing is like I am aware of the fact that m ost might Russian is very casual and conversational and I can read and all that but actual like writing compositions that are formal and whatever I I don't have the schools but that's I feel like I would probably struggle in hig h level Russian because because you have to do everything I can just
Yeah
You know make jokes whatever like
We could take like Russian three though and then just do one year rush one semester of Russian be done but whatever
Interact
It's too late
Yeah I mean it's fine I I plot practicing of Russian with my family and all that so
mhm
I'll just
A friend
What about French culture
One of the kids must read from Honduras and like it's funny because even though Honduras obviously the Spanish speaking country like primarily he um up like pro he went by private schools are taught English
hm
um so English is like like really his best like which is first l anguage um and Spanish you very conversational but he's like it's funny because we have like four five kids to take Spanish in the suite and they all like column out so often on my grammar and like
hm
So funny
Spelling mistakes and stuff
Things about learning a language um like as a just in your family or whate ver it's really interesting because conversation only you are much more li kely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like I have that experience with French like when I talk to people who knew French slang and things like that like it's almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and I feel like it's just it's not as interesting like verses writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is like impossible but then people were formally educated can't write mess
Yeah
so I don't know
What else whatever's more useful you know
Yeah but like
I feel like it's more of a function of like if you learn it conversational you learn vocab and then you learn grammar
I yeah
Like you learn those the same time and
Grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost because it's like t rial and error
Yeah
you can just pick up on it yeah
yeah yeah yeah
but when you learn to formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like
Um
At least in my fears was no actual practice so without like immersion is practice and as such like vocab kinda just is fleeting like you learn it for months to get pass a tough many move on
mhm
It's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way I think  languages are more like gradual that way I feel like learning them formally it's almost Counterproductive
it sucks I hate languages
yeah
a healing which is the only time I would ever like I would be down to learn another language but I would only do it for merch ant
Russian
I wouldn't do it
Russian learn Russian
I'm not learning Russian
I'll help
Russian doesn't have the same alpha does it
come on
Notes are like
Yeah I'm not doing that that's so much work
no come on
What the conversation is fun
That's so much work
It's not healthy just a high
Hi
No that
I'm already I'm already fluent in high
you just said hi
I'm fine yeah
what
hi yeah that's how I say hi at fluid
that's not
That's not how Russian works at the hazy hydration
Okay I can say in English so
No
Russian is a great language
English is the best language
you peasant
Cuz I speak English the best language
You you hasn't English is not the best language
I'm sorry I'm not traveling you'll
I'm like I'm I'm like
Modeling you'll with like a tiny proficiency in Spanish like I can read Spanish
What are we going full like a little extra
I can read Spanish I can't really write Spanish and I can't really understand Spanish spoken as well but I can read it like decently well
That's cool
And that's all that matters
Cool cool
Olivia's uh my sister's um she's minoring in Spanish and she like I was like can you send me one of your like just readings
Huh
I I asked her if she could send me like one of her like paragraphreadings and she just like
Mhm
yeah
Sent me it and I read like pretty I got the main idea of the whole thing
I like while being the tissue inside  okay
wait do you wanna get a tissue
so my last night at benjamin's
I can not take you seriously
okay go
I just like I feel like it's a mirror but it's just not
Like why does it looks like a mir it's cause the rooms are set up literally identically
I'm freaked out oh my god we're being recorded
um okay

So did you get how did you get in your room
uh beth was in it so I was just like can you unlock it please
oh
but it's seventy dollars to replace
For a key I'm like do you think I've seventy dollars to spend
So like I'm just gonna search frantically for it and f hope for the best and then just get  um copied at home depot
and then I'll deal with it the in the after by a seventy dollar key
Yeah
Gaby lost hers not surprisingly
has she bought a new one
no
Um
you have to turn them in though at the end of the year
Really
Yeah
Oh yeah that makes sense I guess they don't you having the key to
Um
But why seventy I looked it up it's a dollar fifty to replicate at home depot
Okay
Oh really
then just replicate it and give the replicated version at the end of the year
Yes
But I don't know if that like counts
Well if they say something then you'll just have to pay
yeah That's kinda my plan

ew
That's so annoying
And then she posted another selfie and she was like um when you realize your parents are cutting you off and like blah blah blah like after college and blah blah blah blah blah and I'm like doesn't everyone get cut off I'm pretty sure people get cut off before college
I know that's really annoying
so I'm like I can't relate sorry about your feeling is turmoil now
Wait do a lot of people from Andover go to UVA
mm like a good amount probably like ten
Like eighteen kids from my class applied which is a lot cause we only have eighty five
Oh my gosh
But not that many people go
Where do people usually go
like Georgetown is the biggest one cause one of our college counselors used to be at admissions at Georgetown
What
So he's got the connects
Will do something
My college
And then a lot of people go to Bowdin or just like
NESCACs
only me
you're the only one
Yeah and only one person applied early this year and he got he didn't get in
aw like denied or Wait listed
I don't know
he might've gotten um deferred
mm
I was talking to this girl and she was so cute she wasa senior who is going to play soccer at Connecticut college
Conn college doesn't even have a softball team
Really
Yeah
rude
she's cute though she I was like oh I go to Tufts she's like
My Uber driver last night went to Colby he was so nice

But he a he was a finance he is a financial analyst and does Uber on the side to pay off loans or something
Oh really
yeah some people just like I don't know you get some interesting Uber drivers I got a really mean one yesterday
why
okay well It was kind of my fault
But I ordered like something at Starbucks and I ordered the Uber when I thought that the drink would be ready when the Uber got there but then the drink wasn't ready so I went outside and I was like hey like they're just making my coffee like can you wait and he was like
do you see the traffic and then he just drove away I was like bye
so did you get the charge of like
It was my fault but he wasn't very nice about it
be like I'll get you one too
I know I should've
like if you wait I'll get you coffee
Wait what do you think were being analyzed for right now
There's was like one you know to start conversation or not
oh I feel like that's better done with a stranger
cause then it's like authentic
Yeah
yeah I don't know or maybe not I feel like with a stranger I would just talk the whole time
I would too do you have a family
Be like what year are you what dorm do you live in uh what classes are you taking
Yeah
What else is happening in life I don't even know we literally j we just saw each other
Wait what are you doing for the Superbowl
and was like
we have a softball party oh okay so we have a softball party and like we have like a beer pong tournament and I really hope my coach doesn't and watch this what's up
And you m you like match with someone so do you know Alison she's a sophomore
No
She's really pretty um we're gonna be in matching zebra onesies
oh my god cute
But I have church five to six and that's what time the like the
So you're gonna go to church
and I feel like a terrible person I like have to also I've been having terrible luck these days I feel like it corresponds
Wait why don't you just go can you go to a d a earlier service
Oh yeah
just go in the morning
I was thinking about doing that Yeah I might actually do that
um
but I have to find one in ln Meford
And then you just watch at the softball house is there a softball house
Yeah
it's the match I will not be living there it's very gross
where
Wait where is it
It's literally like two streets over from hill it's up hill it's on like the same road as the field hockey house which I'm con I'm surprised the field hockey house is uphill
I think I know a girl who lives in there
The field hockey house
Is it like a white house on Boston Ave
Maybe not
It's either white or blue
cause there's a girl who works at LF who is a senior
Yeah yeah she lives there
Oh she does
mm
yeah
You know where that is um
I kept trying to sell people my jeans today like not
mm
Was it the ones on me
No like these ones
Oh really
I was like they were I was do you like these jeans and they were like yeah they're fine I was do you want to try them they're like oh I'm okay I was like okay so you don't like my pants
I'm taking it personally
whatever
Okay what's like the most money someone's ever bought in like one purchase
Uhm
cause with LF like I have to do piece by piece you know
like in little thing
Yeah
like I could never just be like I'm gonna buy two outfits right now
Oh yeah no no no people really go crazy sometimes um
I can I guess I'm thinking like your largest purchase is like what like you get do you get commission
No
Oh like I mean their stuff's so expensive that like
Mine personally
hm
Like the most I've personally done
No like a customer
The most I've ever seen is like two thousand
Yeah thousand I was that that that is what I was going to say
But like honestly it's not as hard as you think
To spend two thousand dollars
Yeah
like you could do it without trying
I don't
No I know
It's so insane it's just like the full price stuff is so much
I picked up a pair of pants yesterday or like the skirt and it was like three hundred something dollars and I was like
Wait what's
One of the things I tried on was three hundred dollars and I was like even with like
A s
Sixty percent off with the added ten I'm like we're still not buying this
I know
No
Honestly sixty percent off that's like what it should be like
The normal price of stuff
Yeah
Yeah I think so too
or less
It is
what time you think we're at
not that I'm like feeling rushed
I don't know do you wanna pull the uh fire alarm and see what happens
you can't even pull it it's just like  flashing
Oh
And we're uh connected to the table
I wonder if my posture is bad I should probably be a little more
Oh mines terrible
Professional here
I get yelled at well I have to like put my scapulas back cause of softball
Um have you sa I don't know what the body part you just said is
while pitching
It's like the like the things on your back that like swivel up and down
Oh oh
So on my pitching side it like drifts forward
Cause you're used to like
cause of like that I don't know why so I l am constantly doing like band work to make it like be in the right spot so like when I slouch like this
oh
that's bad for you
also the other thing is like
my like shoulders like naturally drift forward from like
Really
Sport things
I think everyones' does
No like when I lay down they're just stuck forward cause my muscles are so tight right here
You should should roll
I Should
also have you um signed up for your other psych studies
I did one for an hour and a half yesterday
oh what wait you have to do six
Six hours total
So this will be two and a half
so this two and a half and then I have a half an hour
dang
and then well I need all of mine one before games start
I know yeah you were saying that
Like I can't
But also I just feel like it's better to do them early cause then at the end people will be scrambling
and there won't be as many available
And then
even this one I had trouble getting into
oh
well it's cause it's two people
Oh I see cause usually they are they more
I well no it's like two people per time slot so like
Oh
That's why it was weird that I got like you know how they're like oh this times full so that means me like myself and some other person just sign up to sign up
No I know that's cause when I emailed her I was like oh like I it's supposed to sign up ith a friend like can I just bring my friend she was like oh well if you don't know the other person than cause I didn't realize there was only two people
like not with the friends
Yeah
So I was so I was just signed up with a stranger
Yeah
Thank god I didn't do that ow
Yeah we're friends
What if you like met someone and like started dating them from this
So you're gonna date me now
No no no but like if you had been a stranger
Oh my politics class last year was like
Like some couple like met in his class it happened twice and they got married

Like probably like blatantly taking stuff like not like I was wearing them and didn't take it off
Oh one of my coworkers accidentally like wore a skirt home and she's like I'm so sorry and then you just like bring it back the next day
Yeah it's fine but also wait with that necklace wouldn't it like tarnish anyways or do they actually like gold plate stuff
no It's not like a nice necklace
So like but they're like gonna cost like seventy five dollars

uh
Oh does the Joey go on the weekends
Yeah the Joey goes on the weekends but it wasn't working last night for some reason how can Joey on a friday night  I don't know
I'm don't know probably just because we should be in the library

Oh Andrew Wood

How do you get because based on top on each other
He yeah and whenever I'm pitching in a cage he's there and he lives in hill and then we were in politics together
I thought was friendship man like I'm really rattled like I
Just be like I'd love to get talk causes friends
But then I'll be awkward when you get talk it was
Yeah my thing is like oh yeah let's totally get
What a day
and then what if he went to like pay for them I'd be like no
Wait
What did Elliot say
Elliot was just being like  I'm not feeling it
How is Elliot doing
I was just like
wait what's his he was in my fit group
oh I love Elliot
Uhm
His I was gonna ask him to um softball formal
You should have
Yeah but my no the seniors literally wouldn't let me
why
cause they're like we're so excited about your date and I'm
they're like we can cause originally I was like gonna do Cole or Elliot
not Cole
yeah why does everyone not like Cole
um
It hasn't hit me yet I still like like him a lot
I think like Gabby's like a little salty because he crashed her car
What
Do you not hear that he borrowed Gabby's car and crashed it
Hold on
But don't talk about that cause she like it's really like she feels bad
cause he feels bad
Define crash
He re I mean not like full on totalled it but he rear ended someone
Is he gonna pay for it
Yeah
oh thank god
But I feel he like has to get a job to pay for it
oh that's why he's doing the the f the
The tell all thingy
Yeah I feel bad for him
like obviously he didn't mean
So where's her car right now
it's like in zeta but it's like not driveable I don't think
No cause I was actually gonna ask her if she could
Yeah I don't know maybe fix I don't think it's like hard to fix I just think
I don't know
What a dummy
I know
How did he r oh if you're driving someone else's car you literally drive like five miles below the speed limit and like
It was so funny yesterday we were talking
was he in it alone
Yeah
Have you ever gotten in a crash
Yeah
Was it bad
Yeah
What happened was it your fault
Yeah
oh my god what happened
It was awful
were you texting you better not have been texting
oh no
good
um
It was I was going into my senior no I was going into my junior year
mhm
and I was driving my dad's car
mhm
I'll forget and I was in Bedford New Bedford New Hampshire
mhm
and at my I knew my two friends I lived really close to each other I like thought I knew the way because I was driving from one graduation party to the other and I took a wrong turn and I thought it we were literally like in the middle of nowhere like I was convinced that we were in like a neighborhood area and then I think what's it called
New Boston road where the speed limits like fifty but people drive sixty and at the stop sign was literally in the woods and I missed it and I just like went into like oncoming traffic and I hit someone's back en and then he spun out but like in they literally though like I
Had nothing like I literally never saw the other car so I went to a four hour practice the next day like I didn't even feel sore cause I never saw that car but I completely totaled like totaled my dad's car a
Wait I'm so confused what Wait what is having being sore have to do with it
Because usually when you get car accidents like you subconsciously get like tense even if like it like happens like this like your body just like naturally like whatever but like s I had s that like s is how genuinely I never saw the other car and like
It was wild
Oh was the guy okay
Yeah he was a he was fine I I think he I'm not really sure it was such a blur I thought I killed him I was crying I had nightmares for months after it
Um well it was the first car accident in the past decade that no one died so that was scary
What do you mean
Because people go sixty on it
Oh the first ticket on that I mean the first accident on that road
And that intersection
well that intersection specifically because that st I don't know what's wrong with that intersection
Why don't they just fix the intersection so people stop crashing
I don't know but so I didn't even get a ticket I like cause they're just like yeah
saSo happy that everyone w fine
well that and then also just like it's a really bad intersection and what else well like worst case scenario well there are two things that could have happened one is I pulled out an oncoming car could have come
Yeah I've heard of that happening
and like hit me in the door
that would've been t that would've been
Especially if the car came onto your driver's side
No right cause like it was like this like this his road oncoming me
hm
so if I pulled out like
Then the people would have come
Boom I would have died and then also if it was like half a second sooner I would have hit him in his door but I was going like twenty five miles an hour like I was not going remotely fast I was also lost so I was driving really slow and then if I had also gone half a second later I would have completely cleared the intersection so then it's just like one of those like things and I would just always been like oh my god like thats so scary and like never talk about it ever again but
yeah
Well that's scary
Yeah it was terrible and then what else I just gotten in like baby accidents that I haven't even been driving like one time my dad and I were sitting at a stop light and it was like my first day of school at like my like original like Catholic high school and some guy just like literally like rammed into us
wait oh you repeated
and then
Yeah
but you're kinda young
Yeah and then he like drove away and we were just like okay
okay bye
And oh my gosh my sister was such a bad driver in the beginning she literally was just like driving so slow that she like tapped the car that was the only thing  yeah the car the car we're like we went to pull over to like talk and see if damage and like the guy just drove away and we were like okay
okay
fine
um but it was so funny cause we were in our room and Emma was like
hey
What's up
I'm paige
Hi Paige I'm Eragon
Eragon
Yes
Oh cool what year are you
Um freshmen
Oh me too
Which session is your um psychology class
The twelve o'clock
Must be rough like the reason why didn't choose that section that I wanna grab probably grab lunch
mm I still do that I get lunch before
that's nice
How's your early session
This conversation's so awkward
yeah Um it's been pretty good I um actually most of my friends from pre o we went to the same session
Oh
For psych so basically sit together
What preo did you do
Arts
Oh cool
It's like I think arts it's the new um pre o this year
What did you do
But basically messing around with markers papers and
During that one
but Yeah I mean um like I thought arts are supposed to like only for art students
from S MFA
Yeah
But apparently like I'm not I'm an engineer student
mm
so I still went to arts and there are CS students there also like art and science students so like there are they're in there were not much things to do with the the actual arts like art art museums
Oh really
so we'd basically just u um we went to this like the museum of fine arts for sure we had lunch there was pretty nice but except for that part we didn't do much things about actual art
What else did you do then
uh we we we draw hands
ooo
Like t tracing them
a
or drawing them
Yeah
yeah tracing the hands
oh okay
And um we also went to a laser gun fight
Really
Yeah
Like laser tag
Sorta yeah
That's so cool
Yeah but like I feel like that's that has nothing to do with arts
Definitely not
It's just getting us to
know people
Right
How long was yours
Arts it's like five days
oo
about a week um
Yeah did you do any pre os
Yeah I did fit
fit
same length
mm
I think
I don't remember
mm
Yeah
But different
like
Yeah to to it's probably the longest
Yeah ours started like a little bit after two
mhm
mine's twenty seven to September the second something to's much longer
maybe mine was the same length it was fun though we did a whole bunch of sports
mm
like we had exercise days where we had to pick an exercise you could go outside and run or you could do like pilates or Krav Maga
What's Krav Magra
Self defense
Oo
There were two days I did pilates the first day and I did krav maga the second day
Wow
pilates is is I thought it was like dance exercising but it's not it's so hard yeah and then krav krav maga was it was super weird we just learned some like hiyah
Some like weird self defense tips
hm
and then we had like an outdoor day or you could go hiking kayaking or sailing
oh That's nice
I went sailing yeah
It's like the Boston Harbor
No we went to like Mystic where the sailing team sails I'm on sailing team
oh nice
yeah
hm
I think I have a friend in sailing team or wait wait wait he's nice talking to never mind so
The two weren't related
Yeah so
Where you from
China
Oh cool
So uh
Really had you been to the US before
Yeah I was here for I wasn't here but in like Washington state for exchange student so like for about ten months eleven months
Oh cool
So I was kind of getting used to the US environment a little bit
but uh
What what year did you do an exchange
It's like right after my middle school
o
like I I I think it's between my ninth grade and and my tenth grade
Oh
Something like that yeah
That's cool
hm
I never did an exchange but I've had three foreign exchange students stay at my house
Oh wow
with they from
uh we had one from France
mhm
one from Italy and one from China
that's nice
Yeah
that's nice um yeah I like I s I'm I'm still like uh keeping in touch with my host family I plan to visit them like during this Christmas break
Oh cool
So that's very nice
Yeah that's fun
I haven't seen them f in like four years
Yeah that's a long time but you're closer now
Yeah
Than you were before
Yeah
right
Yeah
Still it's across the country flight
Yeah
It's like
It's far to get to Washington state
Yeah
um I live in Texas
mhm
which is I mean not not quite as far as China but still not here yeah
Yeah yeah I um I'm always one of like go Texas for a visit because uh I like basketball exports
Yeah
So maybe watch them play basketball is a good option but um the thing it's um also my favorite physics teacher he lives he he's from Texas
Oh really
Yeah he's my high school is pretty funny
um
Where in Texas would you go if you went to Texas do you know
mm
good question
Dallas maybe
Dallas really
Or Houston
Houston's it I live in Houston
mm Houston Houston rockets
I Perso
Yeah
I personally feel that Dallas is on the lower end of the cool places in Texas to go if you're gonna go anywhere go to Austin
Oh yeah
because they have lakes and rivers no one else has water
Um and then Houston is fun cause this big city
and yeah we have the rockets and the Astros
mhm
mhm
and then San Antonio cause they have the river walk
Oh yeah
mhm
mhm
And then Dallas because Dallas has nothing
mm
Also the basketball team in Dallas sucks so
Yeah
The Mavericks
Yeah
it's kinda lame
Anyway um
What else
It's just so awkward to start a conversation from like nowhere
Yeah make up one how about this if you could go anywhere in the world where would you go
that's such an ice breaker question
Anywhere in the world I will
Like for me I wanna live in um Sweden
Oh cool have you ever been
Now
me neither
but it looks like a cool place to go
no
Yeah like I haven't been to like the northern European region
Well if if English still counts as part of the Europe union then I have
But I'm not sure if it's still counts right now
mm That's fair
hm
I've been there too
English is England is pretty cool
Yeah
the britain
how did you decide that if you could live anywhere you would live in Sweden
um How could I decide
How did you decide that
Oh um it's just
Culture why isn't probably cause um I used to study a little bit of art so
um I guess the environment there kind of attracts
mmm
me so
That's cool
Stockholm especially good city
O
What engineering Are you doing
Oh human factors engineer
okay
Kind of small program
oh that's cool
yeah Like in my um pre at pre major advisor session we only have like seven people
in
Really
In human factors engineering and others including me there are only two that are major in human factors
Really that's so small
Yeah but um on the graduating class was like forty students last year so I'm not worried people just might just switch in
Switch back in yeah
Yeah
I know a lot of people right now that are trying to switch into engineering
Oh really
Yeah
I was thinking about switching to arts and science
Really yeah I feel like once people get here they decide that they don't want to necessarily do what they've signed up for
Yeah
But yeah I have a lot of friends that came here as arts and sciences got here and then decided they wanted to do engineering
mm
Fair enough the reason why I want to switch to art and sciences is like I don't I don't like computer science
mm
I've heard comp fifteen is pretty hard
Yeah I heard that too
So but I have to take that cause that's kinda the requirements for engineering school I'm not sure but I have to take comp eleven so
yeah
And that is not my thing my plan is to take no computer science classes
What's your major
I wanna do either bio or bio psych
mhm
and pre med
premed
So lots and lots of science labs
mm
Are you taking physics this semester
No I'm taking chem
chem
I heard comments like like I heard chem only has like eight thirty sessions like
There's an eight thirty which is the one that I'm in and there's a one thirty but I have practice during the one thirty so I'm in the eight thirty
My f my uh roommate he's actually doing chem next semester and the only time slot available form him is the eight thirty one
mmm
that's kinda not good
Yeah I don't know it's good because then you get chem out of the way
That's true that's true
And then you can enjoy the rest of your day
that's true
cause you don't have to think about going to chemistry
Yeah I have math this semester eight thirty to nine twenty something for like three days
Love a good eight thirty class I have eight thirties on Monday
mhm
and Wednesday and then the rest is nine thirties
that's nice yeah my schedule this semester is kinda nice with Thursdays and Fridays cause I basically like my classes finish on thursday and Fridays in the morning so like eight thirty to nine thirty and then like another ten thirty to eleven forty five
mm
to like n and like no classes in the afternoon
so
well that's good
Yeah
I feel like the worst would be to have a whole bunch of classes on Friday
Yeah no rest my goal for next semester is to have like three and three and a half days a weekend
ew
Like my my schedule right now um it doesn't have classes on Friday
Wow
And there is no morning classes and you like yeah like so for Monday Wednesday and Thursday I have class starts at one thirty ends about like eight or nine that's fine for me
Yeah
and on Tuesday my class starts at three PM three thirty PM
Starts at three
Yeah
wow
So like basically I can sleep my whole entire morning and then grab lunch and then go back probably go back to sleep again and then go to class
That sounds so nice my schedule for next semester I am trying to make it well I have to plan practice into my schedule
mhm
and my practice is from one thirty to six on Tuesdays through Fridays yeah it's a long time
Yeah
So basically you don't have any free time in the afternoon
Basically yeah and so I have mostly morning classes but the way that I have it set up which I hope works out I only have one class on Friday and it's a chem recitation which isn't mandatory
mhm
and then I only have one class on Wednesdays also
mm
but then I have two six thirty classes like six thirty PM Monday I have a six thirty lab and Thursday I have a six thirty class but it's fine
How many classes are youo taking um next semester
Four
Including the practice
Yeah I have chem English two French four and abnormal psych
mm
I I feel like the practice It's kinda hard
Yeah it's a lot
I
I can never do like four to five or even three hours of might be three hours but not four hours of practice on a certain sports
It's nice though because like since our team has seventy people
which is huge compared to most sports
Oh wow
Yeah yeah
uh so they don't really notice slash care if you're not there everyday
mm
and also like there's two different times you can come at one thirty or you can come at three and then uh Mondays we have no practice and Wednesdays a lot of people don't go because they can't so like this semester I went I went Tuesday Thursday Friday because I have class on Wednesdays
mm
and so it just works
Yeah
Gotcha
How far is it from here
Ten minutes
oh
so we take cars
I see
yeah
Yeah I was uh I was I was planning to try some sports but I didn't get into basketball
uh
So that's kinda sucks but still play basketball casually with my friends
that's fun
It's just like the course load right now I I just finished my mid term last week
Oh
so I'm so I'm just planning to pick up my basketball
Yeah
Hopefully there's gonna be no exams close by I know there's a psych paper right
Yeah the papers due next week
On November the fifteenth
But it's a short paper
yeah
It's like a
so like six hundred words
yeah and like a mini summary of what you read
mm
which is that's easy
I asked professor summers about like what kind of articles he's looking for because like I was kind of confused if he's only
Wanting us to find news articles or news plus psychology analysis
Yeah
so so
What did he say
He he said on just anything anything would anything just related to psychology it's fine
I don't know
Yeah I need to find an article I was talking to someone yesterday who said she's doing hers on PTSD
oh PTSD that's nice
That's a that's a good one I feel like
I think I'm doing gender roles
Oh that's also good
Because like I'm not that into biological psychology it's just too hard for me
I prefer social psych
Same
I'm really excited about this next unit because we're doing social psych and uh
Media
Disorders
oh disorders
Yeah which I think are the the cool parts
mm I feel like it's so cool to like an analyze behaviors
Yeah
Um back in my high school I still I used to take um advanced econ but this class is considered consisted off like multiple areas one part of the class we actually learn behavioral psych so that' really really cool
Really
I I really like that
yeah
So that's pretty nice
Yeah that's why I wanna do abnormal psych
mhm
because that class is about like different disorders
You learn about disorders which I think is the cool psych stuff
I like everything else
mm
I just feel like it's more fun to to learn about what people do and don't do and also now that I've been in this class sometimes I see people and start thinking about what they're doing
mm
like I am part of junior jumbo's
mm
do you know what that is
Okay it's this club where you go to a preschool once a week for two hours and you have a little buddy and you play with them little kid my buddies three
three years old
Yeah
And I went last week after we had learned about attachment styles
pretty cute
and then I was like man I'm watching it applied in real life
mm
Yeah how long is the program like for the club thing
It's the whole year
That okay
do you gotta pick the same one next year as well if you are deciding to keep doing this club
Pick the same what
Like the same kid
No
So like basically one kid per year
Yeah except that someone I talked to said that oh it was a teacher that works in the preschool now that used to do the club she had one buddy for two years in a row
mm
and then a third different one so I guess it just depends
Because
cause I feel like I feel like it's gonna be so um
So cool I guess to keep in touch with the same person for like consecutive years
All of it yeah
Yeah to see what's happening around him or her
I feel like it depends on what age you get when you start off
mhm
because since it's a preschool they get too old to be there
mm
I think the oldest you can be there is five
mm
so in theory I could have my buddy for two years like this year and the next year
mhm
I don't know though
The youngest age is is less than two
Yeah they have baby babies
mm
that's that's pretty cool
Yeah
Waving at the camera
There's also one behind me too
Yeah
Okay
mm
Awkward silence
Okay if I were to go anywhere in the world
Yeah let's th let's let let let's pick up that conversation
Yes I would go to Australia
Australia
Yes  because I wanna go scuba dive uh the Great Barrier Reef because it's so cool
why
mhm
And also just because Australia's I feel like a place it's just a place that you should visit cause they have so much they have kangaroos they have koalas
mhm
they have a ridiculous amount of ocean life
That's true
And also everything that can kill you scorpions snakes
Jellyfish
Forest fires jellyfish great white sharks
So much fun
mhm
Australia seems to be a really nice place my high school used to have like a exchange program to Australia for twenty days
during a winter break
ugh
That's so cool
Yeah
I wanna go I wanna study abroad in Australia
mm That's nice
does tufts have a
cause
Australia study abroad program
I have no idea but you can do non tufts programs
True
So if they don't have one I'm gonna find a way to get to Australia
that's right
also apparently the minimum wage in Australia is really high
Oh
It's like eighteen dollars eighteen US dollars the minimum wage in Texas is seven fifty
For real
Yeah it's super I think whatever it super low
mm
It's higher here than it is in Texas I think it's like twelve here maybe fourteen I have no clue
I'm not sure I can't do part time jobs because for international students we have to be a sophomore year to get my um Social security number
Yeah
So I can't do it
My I don't have one I only work in the summer
mm
at home but I feel like it would be smart to go work in Australia because then you can save up a whole bunch of money and then bring it here
Wait does tufts
To use
will tufts cover your tuition in Australia
I think it's like carries with you
hm
I don't really know I haven't looked that deeply into it
But also I have time
mhm
That's only our freshman year
Yeah
So
Yeah I wanna study abroad too probably Germany
mm
I'm in German one
Oh cool
Trying to do like German one two three four for my freshman year and my sophomore year so that can probably study abroad
Eventually
In my junior year or my my senior year I'm not sure cause the thing it's it's not only the culture but also the um my field in German so popular
like industrial design wise
oh
German has probably the best industrial design programs in the world
yeah
Also Britain but uh
You already speak English you're good
mm
I'm trying to learn German
yeah that's cool
At at least I'll yeah because if I'm going to study abroad I have to be like in German four
So that you can actually converse with people
Right
I take French
mhm
And I wanna go to France this summer the tufts and how are maybe we'll see um but yeah I don't know I've I've been taking French for so long that when I got here I was like well I feel like I have to continue so that I can actually learn how to speak it because French programs in Texas are not very good so even though I took French for like five years
mhm
I learned the exact same thing every year
which is nothing
hm
which isn't super helpful when you're trying to talk to people
True
Are you still learn like two years I'm in actually one year of German back in my high school but that didn't help because we only have two classes per week ands sometimes the teacher would not be there so basically have self studies
You only had class two days a week
No I'm in two days for German
For for German
yeah
Back at my high school
so that's not good because
Wow
Yeah
Once I learn something on Monday I'll basically forgot on Friday
Yeah
and over the weekend I have no incentive to review German then back to Monday I basically forgot everything again
Yeah that's rough
mm
So I basically didn't learn anything from my high school still start in college
You're you're starting over
I guess
Yeah
That's okay German seems hard I have a friend that's in Geone he seems like he's struggling a little bit
mm
he said it's easy but also hard at the same time
who is his it was his name
Cole
Cole
Yeah he's not in my section
Yeah so yeah Germans pretty fun um
Yeah
So are you gonna do did you test out of any of the language requirement
um I placed out of English cause I took AP English back in my high school um except for that one no
But I placed out of some like some physics and chemistry things
so that that that kind of helps
Oh cool
That that that actually really helps saves my time next semester so that so that I don't have to wake up at eight thirty
I got credit for calc
oh calc BC
AB
mhm
so I have to take only one other math and then for English I tested out of half of the English credit
so I have to take English two
mm
and then for language I placed out of French two and th one and two
So you're starting in French three
so I'm in th
yeah
That's really nice I think
Yeah so I'm gonna do three and then I'm doing four next semester and then if I go to France over the summer I'll do five there
mm
And then six when I come back
it's nice I don't th
mm
Yeah for me I'm yeah I'm planning to do like German one two three four for my sophomore and freshman year
And then are you gonna do
Study abroad
hmm
probably
If I have that time
I really want to
yeah I feel like study abroad would be so fun
Yeah
would you go for a year or would you go for a semester
I'll probably go for one semester
Yeah me too I feel like it's just it just makes more sense to only go for a semester
because then that way like you don't fall behind
Right
In anything
mhm
Yeah I don't miss my family And my friends here so
Yeah yeah because if you but also the good thing about if you go abroad junior year is like most people are also going abroad junior year
mm
So like you and your friends might be gone at the same time so then you come back
True
And it's not like like it wouldn't be fun if your friend went abroad like sophomore year and then you go junior year
Yeah
And then you're like friends only for freshman and senior year
mm
True
Yeah and another thing I'm kind of worry about studying abroad it's like
uh a definitely language problems cause although I might study one two three four That doesn't mean like it's gonna help me in the daily conversations
Yeah
Yeah yeah
Still so is the same thing cause we we took English classes back in China but those classes don't necessarily prepare you for English conversations
Yeah that's fair
like
Yeah so like it's only test prep
It's different
yeah
yeah
But the good thing also about studying abroad is that like once you get there by the time you leave you're gonna be so good at conversation
mm
cause you'll only be speaking for the most part in that language for a good chunk of your time for an entire semester
mm
Can you read me
Alpha six go
Yeah is this is pretty cool
I didn't expect this for us
Yeah I don't know I kind of thought there was gonna be something else but I don't know
Yeah so did I yeah I mean
uh
'cause
He had an window meeting about it she just said it was like kind of weird but
Yeah
Maybe that's because I guess you're forced to have a conversation you know
Yeah
It's not something that comes naturally I feel like
Yeah definitely
I'm like picturing scenario like
we're at Dewick
Yeah
We're showing
This is kind of like the table there
Yeah each other
Did I I was like not that hung we only went
I'm probably have the I'm probably not the it up there
Yeah well I mean
I mean I go with you like yeah and I definitely go again I don't need that much so do you want to go to some either now or
Oh I yeah I would that
is that near Davis where is that in Davis
No it's not near Davis it's like the road
cause I know it's like the it's the other side of campus
It's yeah basically
mhm
it's yeah back and near south kind of it's like you go down powderhouse like around the roundabout and then down instead of like towards Davis where you'd go off to the right y you just go straight down
okay
um
That's the you know the cake place I think
Yeah no I think I know where it is
Yeah
If you love oh so it's a pretty close the south
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah I haven't um I haven't been but
I bet everybody says it's good though
Everyone says it's good
mhm
so
We need to go
And do
Yeah I do I ffucking love breakfast food man
Dude best meal of the day
Can't can't turn down breakfast food
Best meal of the day I don't yeah that's why I don't get haris he like wakes up and
cause
What
Mm Haris he like wakes up like what twelve
mm
twelve forty five for his twelve o'clock class and then just goes straight to class for an hour like
Yeah
For me like personally
I can't I need to eat
Food needs to be in me for me to like be able to pay attention
No dude I totally agree
Yeah
I can't really figure out if this is like actually like a glass thing between us
you know what I mean
Yeah
I feel like it is but it like it's like a little weird
I can't touch you
I know it's weird dude it's like perfectly clear except for like right there
It's like not really a window it's all
Yeah
yeah we're In jail talking to each other through the glass
mm
Oh yeah it's like one of those scenes in the movies
oh
Have you seen the one um
in have you seen the psych where they talk to um not Johnny D um
Johnny G's hench person
I don't know who who is Johnny G
He's like uh he's does custom auto parts
I haven't seen that one yet
you haven't seen that one yet how far are you
I j I just I just watched the one where uh
It was like it was like a rich guy who is friends with uh the
It was hen it was friends of had like Henry's friend
Yeah
And his son like went missing
Son went missing
It was a really good one with like poker and stuff
Oh I like that one
It was such a good one it was a really good one
Yeah
it was like
you like know the da or he does like he deals rental cars or something right
Exactly yeah yeah
Yeah
and his son like
Steals money and then goes TO like a big poker tournament like when the money he lost
Yeah
and then Shawn just wins at all
and then Sean goes in and like and then he like beats everybody and then gets the last one and then like the guy was cheating
Figures out yeah
and that was the only way he beat like his son
Yeah
It was a little predictable it was good though
I mean some of them are like can be like
But they're so funny man
yeah
oh my gosh
That I watch for the entertainment
Yeah no like the one oh oh it it ended with like they threw a birthday for Lassiter
Yeah
and they went to his phone book and it was all the people he arrested
I know
oh my god
And Then they're like um gotta get outta here here in the villages to
Dude that scene was so funny
And they just start running yeah
Take off down the street
oh my gosh
Yeah you keep a phone book of all the people you've arrested
That's such a funny line
He has a funny character man He doesn't like he doesn't say he doesn't like have too many like punch lines
Yeah
But like
He's a key character I'd say
Yeah he's mad funny I'm just waiting for Shawn and uh
Jules
Jules to get together
It takes it takes frustrating frustratingly longer than you think
Yeah I know I I had a feeling it would be cause like the writers are probably writing like every episode with that like kind of like awkward like sexual tension
Yeah
And they're just wait and like they don't wanna change it cause once it changes like they feel like change other writing every episode
mhm
so
Um but yeah it's pretty funny
Yeah definitely there's definitely some curve balls thrown in there so
Mhm
Yeah There are definitely times were like I was fuck just happen already
No that one where uh
you know I I thought one of the best ones was like er wasn't like
The best but it was like one of the ones where I had had no idea what was gonna happen it was like the speed dating one
Yeah
Doubt I'd that I have no idea was gonna happen there
uh huh
Um
Yeah that that was a one of theirr more clever ones I'd say
Definitely no yeah um I thought they were gonna like I thought something's gonna happen there low key cause like They like both they like matched at the thing
Yeah
Yeah yeah
Cause sean like copied her answers
He copied it yeah
Yeah I mean I was like wa watching that one again like every time
Like the first time I remember just like not thinking anything of like the woman
Um who was like also like helping steal the information from the people
yeah
She like participated in the dating when he she was like married to Marvin
Mhm
um so I just remember like not thinking too much of her but now every time I listen to her talk to uh um Shawn
Yeah
It's just it's like so obvious to me that she's the one who's doing it because
That's that's how a great like mystery movie works it's like the first time you watch it you're like I don't knowwho did I know who did it
Yeah
the second time you watch it You like oh it's clearly that person like
Yeah
cause she like she literally starts off like oh yeah what's your name oh yeah what's your m what's your maiden name likeyour moms' maiden name
Yeah
And then like what's your favorite color do you have any pets what's your your pet's name
Yeah
it was like I was like alright those questions are happening and are way too specific to be random
Yeah
And um like yep now I think about it those are all the questions you'd see on like a bank security questions and so
Definitely yeah
Like every time listen to it I'm like
alright I see it now
Mhm
Yeah
It was at like I'm trying to think like have you have you watched like the ocean's eleven
Great movie
That's like one of my one of my favorite movies
I didn't see that one coming I did not know is happening in that
I have no idea and like
I y I think that one's such a good movie because like I watched a second time and it's like it's still kind of hard to tell
Yeah it's still it's always a little hard to wrap your mind around
Mhm
um
Yeah it's
um that that one I remember just being shocked cause like
Yeah that's scene I I think that's scene where they like explain what happened
Yeah
It's like one of the be like it's like one of the best like five minutes cause it's like
cause like at that point you're like all right what
you're like what like Da like Danny's being beat up in like a closet by two huge ̲g̲uys
yeah
right and then like
he's like well he's getting prete̲n̲d beaten up right
yeah exactly yeah
yeah
no but you think hes like actually getting beat up
yeah
Um
There were like gar I forget like their there were like guards down there but the guards were actually like with them
yeah l like the uh
what was it oh yeah they oh yeah they played they played like a videotape over the security cameras cause like they built a model um
Oh cause they called the swat team
Yeah
That's what it was
and then they were this and they like changed into swat gear left as the swat team
Uh huh
Um or they came in as the s no they they came in right
they c
Because they came in um when the like alarm went off they came in as
The they they came in for the nine one one call
Yeah and then but like it was just them dressed up in swat gear and so they came they took the bags money and then when they were leaving as the swat they just brought with them
Yeah
Um but and then the whole time they just kind of played a v a videotape of them
Mhm
Uhm
And
So yeah I just remember that being
Pretty ridiculous
yeah it was a good movie
You know they're making a another one
Are they
Not it's not a it's like a
Oh it's girls though right
Yeah it's it's um
What's it called
It's what's his names sister
Danny's sister
It's d anny's sister
Um
And so yeah there may and they're making another one with uh
That's pretty cool
with her and it's like a female crew which is gonna be pretty dope I think
Yeah no that'll be so g is it the same director
I don't know
I feel like it probably is
I don't I
there's probably some type of like
Um
Runs in the family
Yeah that's classic that's gonna be good actually
Yeah I think so too I want to see that
I do I'd love to see like some of the original characters make an appearance though
I'd I'd would be shocked if Danny wasn't in it
Yeah
They like I think they purposely held him out of the trailer too
You think
think so
Yeah
Yeah
Just like so he makes a surprise appearance
yeah I could see that
that actually would make a lot of sense
Yeah
I think yeah
I wanna see
have you ever seen the Italian job
no what's that
That's really you haven't
No
alright we're watching a movie soon
Really
Yeah
what's it what's it abuot
It's kind of an ocean eleven Ask
dude those like my favorite types of movies
Yeah
honestly they're so they're so much fun to watch
Yeah that's
Also one of another really good heist movies
The Italian Job I don't think I've seen it
Really
Is it like when they come out
It's it's pretty old
Okay yeah
It's yeah probably older than ocean's eleven
Yeah
Um alright we're watching that so that's dope
that's good yeah
um
I I wanna sea this is i
it was called downsizing it's like it's like a new mo̲
mm
all these people who were like saving up like their savings for their whole lives
yeah downsizing
downsizing yeah exactly and like they they got their offer to shrink d̲
because it's l̲
ho
b because when you're smaller like to build a house it's just like
yeah
inexpensivelike you you just like don't ha like you know I mean like a huge house̲
yeah
so it's like that might cost like a hundred dollars̲
you know what I'm saying
no not at all
okay so it's kind of like
oh ah ah wait this is a g this is a good way to think about it
is this like an alternate world
no it's like no it's like this company has figured out how to like shrink people d̲
oh sh like p̲h̲y̲sically shrink
yeah
oh so it's like l
oh yeah
I thought you meant like getting fired
oh
No like they're like literally live with their just like smaller
Oh they're small okay
Yeah
And therefore like their money buys more
More yeah
Yeah
That's so that's that's interesting actually
No it it that souonded really that the trailer was good too
They're smaller so they don't yeah they don't need as much food they need a smaller house
Exactly yeah
Um
No yeah I think the one example they use in the trailer was like
They bought like a bottle of champagne and it lasted them like five years or something because they were just so big and they're not that big
Yeah
Which is kind of funny
Get drunk of a little sip
This is a new movie
Came out like I don't know
Oh it came out
Maybe like a month ago
Yeah
I thought over winter break I wanna go see and never did
Been there
Yeah du I I think movies are so weird now it's like s many people don't go but like I was talking to like
Yeah I know I just watch them on Netflix
Yeah people just watch them but like I was talking to
talking to my dad about this actually there's like this new company that like
uh huh
you pay like to get ten dollars subscription or something and you can go to a you can go to uh like unlimited movies per month
At participating theatres
Interesting
Which is like kind of crazy cause like one movie ticket
Yeah
Is probably like ten Bucks
You pay ten dollars a month
Yeah it's why it's insane
They just hope
I don't really understand either
I don't understand that model
How I don't get how they make money
Yeah I know
doesn't make any sense
do like unless they have like agreements with the
Um
Like I can see how that might work like in bulk
well yeah if you have enough people doing it yeah but
If you
Like maybe if they had agreements with like each of the individual movie theaters like they get some kind of a cause like the people are gonna go and probably buy snacks and stuff to they're getting the movies for free
Oh true oh and you know it's like maybe it's also like I have it like I have the subscription and I want to go to the movie
Yeah
but maybe like my girlfriend doesn't or like my friend doesn't so when we go like they still have to pay
Yeah or like you get
But if you got like a like they give you like a card you like show it every time you go in and they like keep track of how many people are um and like the movie theater keeps track of like each everyone who shows like the card what this like that says you have this subscription and then um
yeah
And then basically you get
A little like I guess commission off each person who uses I don't know
Yeah
I don't know I just thought it was interesting
Because it's like
Yeah I know that
And they're trying to get people to go to movies again
People are lazy though
I know I still don't think I would go that often
No like like I would say like
I think for it it's like a really good like date thing it's like autumn it like
Yeah
Right the Somerville movie theater in Davis
Yeah
That's like That's perfect
I gonna use it I wanna go there at some point
Yeah
But like I've been here like you know probably five months and like I I have yet to go there
no yeah  Same
And like I've bo you know if
We had there was a lot but
I mean a really go see a movie
Yeah
Maybe maybe they'll be showing the Italian Job and we can go
That's not
er I don't know I doubt it
yeah probably
They show like old French films
This is French
What
It's it's French
No I said doesn't the Somerville theatre show like well they show like the new they show like some new ones and then just like old foreign ones
Yeah I thought it was like a combination yeah
Yeah I'd g they're showing the post there I kinda wanna go see that
The poster
The post
What's that
Um it's about it's all about the um
New or old
It's a new movie it's like a academy award nominee
Oh wow
Um it's all about the
Which league was it um
Like either the Washington papers or
Oh I saw this is Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks
um
Yes
Yes I really wanted to see that
I get
That looked really good
Yeah
I would totally go see that with you
that's dope
Well I forget what it was about though is about yeah it was about the Washington post
I yeah I don't know too much about it
It was like a s something about a story they wrote or something
Well I think the I think they both work er at least Tom Hanks works for the newspaper that like published the information that they got
mm
er the got leaked um and so I think it was all about like handling it how to deal with that
Mhm
um but I'm not again not too sure
Yeah
How a how are your classes going this semester so far
Yeah the check
Yeah
um
what you in psych
Yeah
How's it how do you like know other people in your class
Yeah I um there's a kid in my German class who's also in psych me so we just walk straight there f um from German
It's good
and then
The German ten thirty
Yeah
yeah
um
our c Like
You have  right
Yeah
Yeah same
Is your class big
like Cabot is like way too big for us
Yeah
it's like
okay same
On I can I can't think we have more than like
Sixty people seventy maybe
Yeah cause I look around and like there's so many empty
Yeah
Chairs
No I definitely feel the same way
Um
but yeah no thanks so it's going well I think that's that hasn't really been a problem I kinda want to do the assignment this weekend
um
Mhm
Assignment one to get it out of the way
It does not look very difficult
It doesn't you just need to find two articles and so I just need to spend the time to do that
Mhm
um
Comp sci has been like
Comp eleven yeah
Yeah has been
Do you like it or
Yeah I like it it it feels so good to like finally get your program Working
Finish your code
Yeah
Mhm
Like after just struggling through it and like getting getting back syntax errors and um
Like oh and just or just like having it not work at all
yeah
kinda like having to figure out why um but
I feel like I'd like that class
It
I yeah I think you would it's definitely it definitely takes time
Yeah
Yeah I like that
Like it's definitely like gets
definitely a week's worth of work cause like you gotta s like the way it works is you get assigned Homework on Thursday
Yeah
Mhm
and then basically you have n till next Thursday to do it all
um so
h How do you guys have like midterms and stuff in the
I don't know I'm kind of scared because like coding takes me awhile and if we have to do like coding in class
mm there's no I don't really think they make you do that
I hope not I don't know I I have to ask Henry see what they did
He's a he's a comp sci major right
Yeah he's in comp fifteen right now
I hear that fucking difficult
Yeah
I'm sure
Yeah I wanted to take I actually wanted to take comp eleven this semester
Yeah
I decided to take calc three instead I'll just take it cause I didn't want to take both
yeah that's Probably smart move
Um
Yeah so I'll take it probably in the fall
Yeah I w wanted to take comp ten just cause it was like it's like comp eleven except not for majors
like comp sci majors so it's likeA lot more easy going
yeah
but I l I literally showed up for the class the first week back and
Like I get there and there are the class is just absolutely packed
Yeah
Like everyone on the waitlist showed up
Yeah
Um so we were like twenty people over capacity
Geez how big is the class
not that big I think it was only supposed to hold like thirty thirty five people
mhm yeah
mm But there ended up being like fifty people there
damn
Um
e
s But like I was looking around and I'm pretty sure I was the only freshman in that room
Yeah
Um
And so yeah he like at the end fo class he was like gonna try and like um find a bigger room so like he could accommodate all the people that wanted to take the class which is like cool but then like you got an email from people saying like no we can't give you a bigger room you need to just Say no
They needed to cap the classes
Yeah
That makes sense
Unfortunately
But you know I how do you like the guy I heard he's a little bit of a character
Which one
The comp sci guy
uh oh the professor
Yeah
Yeah he
Yeah He's
Definitely interesting
He
I don't know it's like hard to describe he's
He's definitely he's very smart
mhm
that's for sure um and
He's like
His sense of humor is kind of like
That's so funny
Yeah
It's kind of like a computer and away he um
Where they keep because like computer science like at the end of each step laid out um and so it
That's what is jokes so
Yeah it kind of so he oh
He's like he always flexes like out cannot process because blank is
It's hard
What what does he like go through coding class there
Hi it's more like the concept so like how to make how to do repetition um in like how to make the code do the same thing over and over for like an X amount of times um um so it's more like bigger concepts like that last class which is a fully like kinda went through how the computer thought about it or like you have basically every code and then
Mhm
Your word yeah you have your code and then
A lot of what coding is is functions which is like code inside of it's like
At this it's a string with like code inside of it so if you call the function than the code that's inside the functional run and you'll get like at
Oh put
So like X squared for example
Sure
Like that's that would be like a he had the square function or whatever if you like name your function like square and then wroteinside it how to like
Mhm
Yeah
Then um basically when you call a function M that'll run the what ask you to like input the number and then a like run the code and it'll um give you a number back and so he like to basically talked about how the computer will
Kind of for each action within that um within the code inside the function it a like um so if you wanted it to print hi or whatever it like create an activation record for print
Mhm
Yeah
And then it will a good like analyze what it wants to print to be like okay once we print I can do that
Okay
It'll send that back
It's pretty cool
It'll print that and then activation record will go away and
It
I don't know it that the special just gonna help me like wrap my head around um
Like what the computer is actually doing did the we're doing
Yeah it's definitely it's definitely really cool field like my dad like
I was like no like I'm helping pay for a college education this is the one causing did say
Yeah
Which is caught like comp eleven
I mean its fair
Uhm
That's so that's for Yeah
No no no and I like wanna take it anyway
Yeah
Thank you I think it was like kind of joking but
My dad thinks it yeah the same way it thinks it should all
Uhm
Just so it's like for everybody like understand like even though like or even a couple of is just like the basics right yet see plus plus
Yeah
Oh well we're doing python antsy both of
Okay
But like so I could just like now like you since you're able to code and both of those it like enables you to do jobs were like which like eighty percent coat eighty eighty percent noncoding but like twenty percent cutting
Yeah apparently after
Comp eleven and comp fifteen were at like an employable level of
Really
That's that's what someone told me around it's very
That's pretty cool
Yeah
You're gonna keep gonna
Oh sell the rest of us are you has
The
Uhm figured out from here
Definitely
So taken is intro to finance class with the
My profession and David just go
He's like this guy who's never top before he's a tufts alarm
And he worked in finance for like
Thirty years whatever and I was teaching us he's such a character it's hilarious
Wow ok
He's not he's a really funny
Wait
It's good
He's he's also he's actually like a good teacher like
Is he a good teacher
Feel like a lot of those people are like I don't really know how the T a yard like it is it's like knowing the information doesn't enable you to teach the information
That's true
Right it's like
How will you convey it to people who don't know
Exactly and so using like techniques
To try and like
Yeah
We only did yeah exactly just like demonstrated in a way that makes sense um
Yeah or
Yeah he's he's doing a good job of doctor it's really it's a really instinct us
What do you what he is doing when you learn about
So we start off with like my present future value of money
Okay
um so is the that that part has been pretty like equation happy
The question yeah
So it's Bella Akeno
F V was Peavey times the rate
Yeah
To like
RT or whatever
To anticipate yet um you
Yeah
That piano which is like period's and
Yeah
Then as the years
Yeah
Which is like it's interesting
The classic equation
Exactly yes like we start off at that
But you
Uhm to start off with that we did
Mr then we did like we doing with cash we did more of class cash flows so like
Yeah
um like figuring out
Kind of like how to compare investments based on your cash flow
Which is pretty interesting that's a more equations basically um
Mhm
Now oh um we just finished
This thing called an PB and I are which is like
And TV is not present value
For yeah
And IR is
Something rate of return investment return probably
This
Um that's that's late that helps with like evaluating investments it's pretty interesting
Interesting
Um
Yeah like it we're movie on the bonds now which I think would be really cool we talk about like Bon pricing um and like it's the bond markets
That's a lot of work for intervention
Let's see we've had the first problems that was like the easiest thing I've ever done
You've only had one then
No we had to early like a third under on Tuesday
Uhm they like art
The second always difficult like
I
Like the first half was really easy and then the second half was like
Like more like word problems in like excel
Oh my god
We're being watched
How are you
oh my god
how was your day
It was it was like take a picture of this but I don't
In your mind
anywho
how was your day
it was good how was yours
good
I saw you in s wait so when are you seeing interstellar
um Friday or Saturday
in Tisch
Yep
okay

Okay
Now I feel sorry coming
um he might I don't know
okay
we just saw him in um Dewick
oh right okay
yeah I've seen it like three times
nice
Have you seen it
So cool
the interstellar
Yeah
no
It's so good
Like really good it plays with your mind
really I have not seen it in
Yeah
it's kind of like um inception I haven't actually seen incep inception
mhm
but it's like that
okay I haven't seen inception
Okay
it's just like mind games and stuff
Imagine if you were doing this with a stranger what if we were doing this with Dylan
stop
Wait if it was me you dylan and malcolm
Like Dylan and Malcolm
Like
To
Half of us were on one side and half of us were on the other
that'd be weird it looks like a mirror
I know
but it's not myself
I know I know
Freaky
like Really clear glass
Like if I do that you would do that
Okay wait wait wait
oh my god
It does look like a mirror
yeah
see like They're identical rooms
Yeah they really are
Wait we have the
do you have a tree right there
yeah
Yeah
Yeah look at that
Everything's the same do you have curtains on the side
mhm
That's why I think the right like I feel like I'm looking at myself right now
Yeah same
But that's not what they look like
Also can I can see myself kind of in the reflection of the glass
yeah same
so weird
Um Christina's brother is coming
Oh my god
And I think we're gonna go to Boston Burger company
When
On Friday
so fun
yeah
hoo
wait he goes to carnegie mellon
yeah
Is he home for the whole weekend
Yeah apparently it's not actually for her it's like he has a the high school
It doesn't it doesn't his best friend go here
something like that but his height his boarding schools' near here so he's it's it's like a whole like a thing
mhm
but he is like s visiting Christine at the same time
that's so cute
so yeah
so burgers interstellar
ah
what else
homework
mhm
you've off Monday
Yeah
thank god
I forgot about that
hm
I have no lab

so I have two weeks to do my lab
so nice
yeah
wow I'm jealous
You're not even in a lab so
Yeah
yeah
Anyhoo
Are you planning on taking bio thirteen
Wait
fourteen
I'm just gonna take thirteen in fall next year
And then fourteen
Because I talked to my yes cause I talked to my um
My advisoor didn't know anything
advis
really
Yeah
that's not helpful
I emailed a person in the bio psych department and was like hello
please help me figure out my life
mhm
but they haven't emailed me back
mm
Interesting
Hopefully they do
wait did you email the girl that we went to see collecs
No
I think I figured it out I wrote I wrote out all the classes I should take until like spring of sophomore year
okay
and it seems logical
wow
oh my god
I know it probably won't happen cause it's like all science
mhm
and I in even like distribution and stuff
Yeah
But
honestly like might take like a because we need like art right
Yeah
Might like take one next semester
I was gonna do ballet but I I just can't
Why
I also have to like
what
why can't you
You have to much stuff I'm taking five classes
Really
e with three labs
bruh
You should ta drop like not take one that you don't need to take
But I need to take
oh right
don't take bio fourteen
No I need to
Okay alright
Because otherwise I wouldn't get to like bio psych classes until junior year
But because they both they require bio thirteen and fourteen
Yeah
oh
Interesting
when I can blow into I can hear it
me too
Okay it's so strong
I feel like
wait can you hear me
wait whisper
hello
wow the audio's so good

I think I'm gonna get my second piercings I I told you this but I stop
does that sound loud
No
Nope I want my cartilage but stop
But I don't oo oh no but I don't want it to hurt for an eternity
No you know why because okay so when you have your little cartilage you can't it's not a good idea to get it during winter
or like
cause cold
Because cold and you get you cause it get sensitive also if you wear like hats
or like hoods it like can infect it
Yeah
oh
but um
cause you need to have your hair covering it like it's not good if you have your hair covering but like in winter your hair's
But I think my double piercing
yeah you can do that
Um but I can't do it during summer because like summer and I'm not in super great conditions cause I live in the woods
Right
I feel like dirt
No seconds are not a big deal
no no I I know for cartilage
Oh oh oh I understand
it's just never a good time
you do it spring
Yeah when I was um like six well I got my piercing when I was six and when I was like seven I was like I need to get my double piercings and I just never did I don't really see the point I just like wanna do something

I'm also chopping my hair
Yes
Like
I'm influencing you
to to to to shoulders
It it doesn't look that long but it's it
Yeah no no I know just cut it to your shoulders
Yeah I know
cutting it like that
Yeah you should
But cause last time I did that I hated it
I know
But I never like used to wear curly and now like I I manage my curls better
mhm
I love it
So I feel like it'll look better shortened curly
than it did before
Yeah
you should do it
But it also looks good short and straight
mm
I feel like it's easier to just take care of
mhm
and it's been s this long for like three years now
mine's already grown so much
No it hasn't
Like I can put in a p like a huge ponytail
Look at this
You could do that before

Wall
