I can hear your mouth noises 
 
I can hear your mother noises cause you're making though on purpose really loudly 
 
this is literally so bizarre  cause it looks like a mirror  like it would 
 
yeah  I feel like it t- like be a mirror 
like 
I know  it's like  
Anyway 
 
This is like we're in jail so which one of us is in jail and which one of us is visiting the other 
I mean  realistically it's probably like I end up in jail 
For what 
 
I don't know 
Like tax fraud 
Yeah _

cause you'd you doctor you forget accidentally  
it would be like an accident yeah 
I would definitely go to jail accidentally like I wouldn't purposely like rob someone but I would like  trip and bump into someone and they like hurt themselves 
and  then sue me 
Yeah 
 
No yeah that would probably happen to me like I could definitely see

myself like  getting myself into something like that I didn't

mean to get myself into 
you're like  think you're just at like  normal hang outs

and like by the third time you're like hanging out with these

people you realize you're like planning

a robbery and you're like well 
I'm like oh shit I already committed 
Yeah and  you would 
Can't ditch now  
You wouldn't commit  all the way  
 
yeah I don't know I don't know 
 
hm 
but I have a pretty strong moral compass 
 
Cookie 
well okay cool 
 

 
Anyway 
 
What would you go to prison for 
 
stop it 
um 
 
I don't even know I feel like 
 
Like  manslaughter  but like where it's accidental 
like what degree 
 
Like the lowest one but I'd just like accidentally kill someone 
 
Okay 
 
which would suck 
 
that'd really be a bummer 
That's like my greatest fear 
like  actually  it kind 
 
Okay  so I always like tweek out like have you heard of the butterfly effect 

I know that 
 
Yeah 
you hit everyone 
 
No I don't I haven't hit a single person I hit everything 
yeah  true  but like when you're driving fast you're like if someone just like  walked in front of my car 
 
they would die and like  there's nothing you can do about it 
 
like  literally you could like go to jail 
like  which would be a bummer 
That would be a bummer 
 

Yeah that's true 
 
I agree woah we have the same  plant and picture 
No Way that's really true I think that's why It should be a mirror 
That's why it literally looks like a 
 
When I walked I was like fully tripping up  it's

exactly the same  like everything 
o you think we're allowed to use our phones  I wanna take a

 
we shouldn't have talked on the way over 
I know 

Let's talk about  a thing 
 
Lacrosse 

 
A mirror image 
 
just like 
imagine being wait she hear us whether we whisper or not 
 
that's true you're whispering into a microphone 
but like 
 
just like  she just like looks on the fucking screen like   
 
Um  my favorite part of lacrosse is when I stuff the shit out of you um 
Oh 
Yeah 
You mean never that's I'm sorry  you must hate lacrosse 
Yeah that's uh that's why I'm actually thinking about quitting 
 
Woah 
 
What are you woahing 

 
May is bringing another person to dinner 
 
Who 
 
Her brother 
 
I might also bring my brother to dinner 
 
We can just leave him in the car 
 
true 
 
I'm not bringing my brother I think my brother has soccer today  um  he's the team manager  uh 
 
o basically he's not athletic enough to like 
o h 
Yeah 
woah 
it's tough he got cut he tried out but  you know if he had stuck with soccer the whole time like he was wicked good in middle school 
yeah 
then he quit in high school and like senior year he's like yeah I'm gonna try out f or soccer again like yeah good move bud 
 
My dad's been saying for legit years he should've stuck with  soccer 
mimicking dad 
he should've stuck with soccer 
mimicking dad 
 
But  yeah  he ha- he has fun doing it now 
 
so 
 
mm 
 
feel like this is gonna be like a thing  like she was using her phone like 
Yeah No that's definitely going to be a part  
How do they social interact 
and then  it's going to be like talking about like how the conversation kind of like lulled for a sec when you went on your phone 
but No 
but no icking it right back up 
but it's not gonna lull 
 

greatest fear 
 
my greatest fear? 

 
real talk? 
yeah 
 
Like  the fact that  like we have no  control over anything ever and like  we can like 
 
like we can like say like  oh like I care about this so much like oh this is so important but like at the end of the day we're all just gonna be like a speck of nothingness on the entire line of human existence and human existence itself is probably gonna be a tiny little, 
 
spot  on  the entire universe which what the fuck is the universe we can  s̲pend our days praying to a god and even if that god's real doesn't fucking matter ccause we're all just gonna die anyway 
whoa  I would say  mine is, 
so yeah that's my greatest fear 
I think, 
and throwing up 
 
You're like that and bears 
I gotta knock on wood a desk gotta knock on wood 
so you don't throw up 

ye-  b̲ears 

 
no I was joking, 
oh 

 
Um  it's a 
 
Not really a fear but like that does kind of freak me out like 
 
It's so trippy 
 
yeah like 
 
like 
Well why do we like 
like  what's the fucking point 
Like why do we 
 
like adhere  to these like societal norms like why are we nice to people why like was what's the point because  we're just gonna 
Well that's my question we're we're just animals like what  like why am I 
Like why do I feel the need to like  what does it matter if I like  am nice to somebody 
Exactly and like there's like I I don't I guess I don't real ly know _

but I am like I have to be 
what like a sociopath really is but like when you think a like a sociopath that's like 
 
omeone who like 
just a normal thing like that shit you know  like 
It's just like someone someone who's like a sociopath just like 
 
Doesn't like have like empathy or whatever but like 
 
yeah 
 
We don't like  foster empathy completely ever  like aren't we all little bit  sociopathic  like  you can say like oh like I feel bad but like 
 
It's like 
 
Yeah yeah  we we're h-  we're here having a deep conversation about like the universe and fucking 
 
sorry but um but whatevs 
 
it's okay I'll get over it 
you're gonna hear it blows nose mm nice 
 
there we go oh shit 
um 
 
it's like the 
 
omething else I find interesting is like  why do we 
 
Isn't it weird that when you're born you're immediately like in 
 
Like how you  the government can just send you to prison like  you never agreed to be part of the society does that make sense 
Yeah 
they like well 
You're like forced to be in 
There's this whole like idea of like the social contract and like the consent of the governed but  literally like  by being born  for eighteen years  you have like 
 
No consent 
There's no way to just live  free like  truly 
But like would we want to is the thing 
Oh no   
 I don't t hink so but I just think it's f- Like 
 Like 
 
like It's crazy to think about 
And it's really weird to think that there's like really not that much that separates us from 
 
Any other animal so why do we think we're so much like different 
cause we got the brains  
well but that's my thing like why do we think that everything animals do is just like animalistic and purely evolutionary but then everything we do is somehow different 
yeah 
 
Like I don't wanna say like everything in like psychology and shit can be explained by like the like  evolutionary like 
Yeah 
  
View point but like 
    
 
   

Yeah 
 
e- I don't know I'm just in intro to psych 
 _

what do  I know 
true 
 
true 
just ask Lis-  Lisa 
yeah we should get Lisa in here 
we should get 
Lisa 
 
what if Lisa sees this footage because she's a  researcher 
 
Lisa  we love you 
 
Lisa we love you 

 
um 
More than am  sorry am 
I like am 
I like am a lot 

It's funny cause they're like both good 
They're both great 

And I some some days I need am 
ome days I need am 

  honest 
somedays I need a little little joke like 
Yeah no and like Lisa does joke 
Lisa definitely does 
 and she shows great video clips 
great Videos 

Honestly both of them do 
Both of them do 
I think they both make the slides 

yeah they might do it together that's  really great collaboration  
I think  they know how to break it up 
 on their part 
by giving us like clips 
I I completely agree 
And also it is helpful like it it's a good example 
I was fucking dying laughing in class the other day it was 
 
omers mike fell  
oh yeah 
and he was just like 
 
oo 
 
yeah 
 
Anyway Lisa if you're watching and you'd like to give us tips on how to do your ha- on do our hair  
Like your hair 
Like your hair  feel free to forward that information along 

 
just like write in on the back of my next test 
Molly dot oh shit did I put the dot 
 
I don't know if I  wrote my email correctly on the form 
it's probably okay 
 
bu 
 
This equipment is so high teck 
It really is like I feel like  like  like this is definitely much more legit than the  one of the other ones I went to _

what _

it was so dumb 
which one did you do 
so I did this one 
 
And basically  so we had to watch  a silent film 
 
And then  we had to listen to an audio that described the silent film  but they weren't like exactly the same 
 
then I had to play Tetris for awhile  which it was my first time ever playing Tetris can you believe that 
I played so much I played so much  Tetris growing up 
 I was nineteen and I had never played Tetris 
 
Anyway and then I had to like answer questions but the questions could only be based on the audio 
 
Like if it was something that we knew  I knew happened in the film  like I wasn't sure if it happened in the audio too I just 
Had to say I didn't know 
 
And the like after that we had to like answer questions about the differences between the film and the audio 
 
And it took like an hour and a half and it was just like  so stupid and then like  I found out I was the control so like m- that's why it was so stupid like  and like the actual ones like  they see how you do like under stress or whatever so like 
yeah 
 
It's um like 
 
like you you could do it like  like one thing that they did was like they put your hand in ice water 
oh 
 
Which 
 
That would be kinda stressful to me I don't like that 
Yeah I'm  I'm usually the control 
 
like I've always like 
I've only ever been the control 
Yeah I'm always like wow this is dumb  and then I'm like oh it' s because normally they there's like a point to it 
Yeah this s- th- s-  a change  
 or some shit 
I a 
I did 
but _

 
one where  like all of them up until now I've just been sitting in front of a computer 
 
same this is my first one thats not just like 
Yeah 
 
Yeah  yeah there's one I was like 
 
Given a monologue to memorize and I like  obviously you're not gonna memorize it but 
 
Come on aren't you a woman of the stage now 
Well not memorize 
you have to like read it four times  and then you like answer questions about  something and then you have to stand up in front of a camera and like read it again 
 
o bizarre 
like out loud 

Yeah and it was supposed to be like  the character  was 

black  and so they were trying to see like  how you

played like a p- I don't know 
Oh 
 
interesting 
It was cool 
 do you feel like 
 
Any like internalized  like 
no 
This some deep down  like  that's not what I'm trying to say but like you know how like like me like I grew up like  just like surrounded 
 
By white people so like  I guess I wouldn't like know    _

if  I had been doing something  that's not  right  my whole life like you know I mean like 
yeah 
yeah 
 
Not 
 
Not trying to but like 
Yeah 
 
H-  it  could happen  
Yeah 
that's like 
 
that's why I kinda like  feel bad when like celebrities get like  um canceled  like you know what I mean  like 
 
cause they 
 
well the problem is like 
 
Is that 
Ignorance is  not necessarily intentional and yet  it is like pretty toxic 
Oh yeah I think it's absolutely toxic 
s- _

I think the people who do nothing are just as bad as the people out there with like fucking hoods on 
so it's 
but like sometimes 
 
but like sometimes  I get what you're saying because sometimes ignorance is like  sometimes ignorance I think is  um 
 
Bad like  why haven't you like educated yourself but also sometimes ignorance is just like  people can't help like the  people they grow up around 
Right 
so like 
 
A lot of times pe-  people get in trouble for saying like  faggot when they were like 
I hate that 
I hate that so much so much 
I hate that word so much  when people say that I hate that but  I didn't  if you say the F word people don't know what you're talking about 
 
Yeah I know 
mm 
if I try to specify a bit 
w- 
 
I feel like they're gonna be like wow look at these um homophobes  
 
no if y- 
 
no um 
 
okay  um  but like 
 
that like they said that when they were like eighteen

growing up in like high school  
Yeah 
 where everyone's white or and ev- or everyone's straight 
Everyone's straight 
and like they don't know anything 
like that they surrounded by Heteronormativity 
and they just say that stuff 
Yeah so it's like 
 
when you're a kid like it's harder to not be ignorant 
 but then when you're older but they get trouble for 
Well yeah 
That's what I'm saying I think it's sad when like  people don't have an opportunity to change cause like not everybody is brought up like just  being taught the right thing 
 
And like  not everybody grows up n- like I literally like 
 
I  maybe like knew like  on more than just like a oh I know who this person is I literally knew on like a personal level maybe like 
 
Two people of color before I came tufts like  I'm not exaggerating  
wow 
like  Newburyport is so 
 
That's crazy 
Homogeneous  it's it's really crazy 
But 
 
wow 
 
Yeah but I mean like  obviously I'm the type of person who like is Like liberal 
Yeah 
so like I'm gonna 
 
That's crazy 
like educate myself and shit but  like 
Yeah 
 
Yeah  so 
 
You know but like there's like  like this one kid in my town 
And he's like  he's been one of my best friends since I was 
 
Younger  and he's 
 
Like 
 
traight rich white whatever it like  stereotypical Newburyport  boy and like 
Yeah 
 
He's like the type of kid who like  thought it would be like thought it's like okay like make fun of the kids with special needs are like 
 
Yeah 
ay like gay as an insult and shit like that and like 
 
Do you remember when I posted on my um  insta story like of the canon  it's so like we believe survivors  the canon here 
I'm never on your insta 
 
true true _

 I literally only go on insta _

But I do remember the cannons 
but yeah the canna- s-  canon said we believe survivors _

Yeah 
and so 
 
I like put that on my story  and he like slid up on it and he was like  I survived a tornado once I was like what  I was like what you talking about like why are you even like saying this  and  and he was like well l- you're saying you believe survivors so I'm telling you my stories I go like this isn't like funny this isn't like something to joke about he's like wait no like I seriously don't get it and I was like  this I'm  speaking about sexual assault and rape like how we believe females when they tell their stories and males too 
yeah 
and Anyone really  and  he was like oh shit like I didn't

even know that was happening like I didn't know that was a thing I

was like  he didn't know that was a  thing 
what 
 like what have you been doing but it kinda just like shows how like 
 
rivilege can like lead to ignorance cause like  he didn't feel the need to tune into the fact that a rapist is gonna be on the upreme Court cause why does he care he's 
yeah 
 
It doesn't really affect him 
It doesn't affect him 
yeah  he'll have rights no matter what 
exactly  no one's  taking away rights from 
 
white men  with money 
 
that's wild 
 
mm 
Yeah anyways it's been awhile since I talked about politics since uh  
 
You know like me and Monica don't really talk about politics  
 
but yeah 
 
Is she like 
 
Not liberal or whatever 
 
he's registered as a Republican 
 
But like socially 
but like 
 
so yeah she's like socially liberal but that's like kind of I kind of have a problem with people who are like  just socially liberal cause like 
 
In the U like  nothing's going to change without money and like 
 
A lot of the times 
 
They play into each other like  people of color  are not just oppressed socially they're opressed like financially 
Yeah 
Because of a lot of the social obstacles in place  and so like  for someone to be like 
 
ocially liberal but still like  wicked fiscally conservative just kinda like shows like 
yeah 
 
You 
 
Like  it's like you're aware that you have privilege and you're like oh that kinda sucks but you don't really want to change it 
Yeah 
Like 
makes sense 

Yeah _

and _

yeah _

 _

It's got like really good acceleration and really good handling o _

and it it's the single most terrifying thing to experience _

mhm _

Oh my god _

cause I'm sitting in the front  and like all of a sudden he'll just like floor it and go like ninety miles an hour  c- like go ahead of this one car and then like change lanes again and that  I got like so numb to it by the end I would like sit in I be like sitting in the front and he be doing it _

oh my god _

 _

And like another friend will be sitting in the back and they'd be like clenching their seat really freaked out and I just feel like  ho hum _

 _

Wait how far were you from your high school where you had to use the highway _

It was a twenty minute drive  we used  to take the train  _

Really _

yeah _

oh damn _

um  in freshman sophomore and part of junior year I would take the train every single day _

mhm _

um _

 _

And yeah it would like it that was like a that was like a twenty minute train ride  um and then  once like everyone got like cars they could drive and got a license um we started car pooling and stuff _

 _

mhm _

But by by the end of it I started driving myself cause it was really relaxing to be able to like listen to my own music _

Yea _

and everything on the highway _

that's true _

 _

yeah I know mine was like a five minute drive  but um yeah I would just like have my mom drive me  um  and then like when I got my license I would like drive myself _

Yeah my my parents never drove me cause my dad was busy and my mom doesn't drive on highways _

Yeah _

yeah  yeah we didn't even need highways but it was like it kind of sucked cause I wasn't able to drive all the time  cause like I didn't have my own car I'd have my dad's car  so I can like only like use it if  my mom wasn't working  and then my dad would take her van and I would take my dad's car _

 _

o that and that was the only thing that worked _

Yeah _

 _

I m- so _

Yeah _

 _

uh yeah I have like the a car that was like designated for like me and my brother even though anyone in the family would drive it _

mhm _

 _

and um my brother couldn't drive it until like the summer But once he could it got really annoying cause I just wouldn't have the car available _

Yea _

and like in the summer it was like senior year it was like the summer after senior year o I was doing like the most driving and I was going to like the most places I'd ever like gone to before o it was like it was really annoying where I'd be like oh yeah I'm trying to go to like this friend's house this afternoon my mom's like na my brother  your brother took it to football _

 _

That that's what happened to me cause like my dad was gonna get um a new car and then his current car was gonna become mine and my brothers  and like we ended up going to Europe so then we like  like  that money was spent on Europe  but um  yeah like like the whole summer I would be like oh like I need the car and then my brother would be like  oh like I'm taking it _

No  I need it this is my car _

and I was like no and like it sucked cause like he was older than me so he like he did get priority _

That's annoying _

and I was like ugh  yeah _

 _

I don't know now now like most of my friends just drive _

it's it's fine _

Yeah and like I had a I had a lot of friends who like had their own cars they were just drive me places _

Yeah  I feel like most people in New York don't really  drive around though most of the people I've talked to haven't really like gotten their licenses _

It it depends where you're from like from the city like there's no point if you're from the city there's really no point in getting your license _

cause you're not gonna drive in the city but like Long Island like _

Yea _

But like  it's good to have your license _

Yea _

ooner rather than later _

Yeah like everyone in Long Island has their license _

Yeah  driving w-  driving on like the highways is like definitely like one of my favorite things to do _

Yeah  yeah _

And like in California there's this one highway where  it's it's like runs all it's sort of like runs through these like hills and it's really beautiful _

mhm _

and there's like fog rolling over them and everything so  it's just like a really cool place to drive in _

Yeah _

like you can go really fast there cause there's like There's no cars _

Yeah _

and also there's no cops so you can go like way faster and they don't really care _

 _

Um so _

Yeah  yeah  yeah I know it's definitely rela- relaxing but like  the only time I would really go no the highway is like  driving from like driving to and from work I would use the highway and then like  if I would just go to Jersey with my parents I would drive on the highway _

You'd do the driving for that _


Yeah  well I would drive  home cause usually my dad would be like um going there we'd have like we have to be there by a certain time so I'll drive  but it's like stressful at night _

 _

oh definitely _

Like because it _

 _

night driving on the highway with a lot of cars around is really stressful _

yea _

it's like it would always like make me really anxious and it would take me like half an hour until like I got the hang of it _

Yea _

 _

Yeah _

 _

But like usually I'll just drive on local roads cause I never really like needed the highway _

we w- _

Now it's far  we would drive up to we drive up to lake taho whole lot _

 _

mhm _

and the dri- like the first half is just like long boring highway driving _

Yeah _

 _

But the second half is like really windy like two lane highways with a lot of like giant trucks and it's like really sketchy _

mhm _

like you've got a wall on one side and like a cliff on the other it's like really freaky _

Yeah _

And um  like I I learned how to do that driving eventually and it was it's you need to be like focused and locked in like twenty four seven when you're doing that _

yeah and like I just like I tend to like zone out when I'm driving it either like I like pay attention to music or I'll just like relax too much _

Yeah I can't do that _

o like highway driving like I'm like I need to pay attention to everything happening _

mhm And when you're doing it at night you like get you get drowsy _

Yeah  yea _

so like my dad like he like n- he never really let me drive on the highway unless he was with me  or if my mom was with me like I wouldn't be allowed to drive on the highway by myself _

 _

I think the  DMV called it like highway hypnosis or something like that  I don't even know I don't even know why I still remember that _

That makes _

that makes sense that makes a lot of sense  yeah I like don't understand how people Iike  still don't have their licenses I literally got mine like the week after I turned sixteen _

Really _

well I didn't get my license I got my learner's permit like the week after I turned sixteen  and then I  took my road test when I was  seventeen _

 _

I think I got I got my permit um about when I was sixteen when when did I get my permit _

Yeah _

 _

Yeah I got my permit like a  decent amount of time after I was sixteen and I started taking lessons and then _

 _

um When did I fini- when did I pass my  te _

You can  you can take your uh you can get you license at sixteen in California _

Yeah _

 _

Oh my god _

it really do be like that _

In New York it's like you can get your permit at sixteen and and then um _

Fifteen and a half in California _

 _

oh my god _

It's nice _

that is insane _

I actually failed my permit test the first time _

 _

That's insane _

Which is dumb cause it's the written test  it's like so easy  and I just bombed it _

the first time _

Oh my god yeah for us it's like when you're sixteen you can get your permit and then  when you're seventeen you can take your road test but it's either like you have to have your permit  for  six months  o _

Yeah I know it's _

Or you have to be seventeen _

Yeah _

 _

And then you get your juniors license _

You have a junior's li- _

But _

oh no there's the provisional license _

Yeah _

yeah _

so you get like your juniors license which is like you can drive alone to and from school and work everywhere else you have to have someone who is twenty one _

oh really _

Yeah _

Ours is li- but the professional licenses uh  I think you  have to  I think learner's permit is you have to drive with someone _

Yeah _

so that you can be that you could be doing that as soon as you're fifteen and a half _

mhm _

Then you have provisional license where  I think you can't drive other people and you have to be you can't be driving between um  eleven M and six AM _

For New York it's  five no _

 _

Nine M to five AM _

you can't you can't drive _

Nine _


 _

That's  harsh _

By yourself well  you yeah you can drive but also like that's like just Long Island like New York City's so much more restrictive _

I I mean I can imagine _

Yeah _

it's crazy there _

and then like when you're eighteen you get your _

 It's like mostly taxis _

Yeah you get your full license when you're eighteen  or if you  get your drivers license  when you're seventeen but then you take driver's ed  no okay wait if you take driver's ed and then take a road test you get your full license even if you're seventeen but  I didn't take driver's ed cause like  I would only have my juniors lessons for like three months and then like or like six months then I would get my full license so I'm like I can wait it out six months like I'm not gonna pay like four hundred dollars for it _

 _

for drivers ed _

Yea _

 _

yeah  it's not really worth _

Yeah  there's like  so many stages and like I think what they're learner's permit like you have to be with a parent or a guardian  you can drive within certain hours _

 _

mhm _

and then junior's license you can only have like one other random person in the car  um you have you can only drive alone to and from school and work and you have to  everywhere else you have to have like an someone who's twenty one or over _

no _

driving  just like having the the freedom to drive and like  Junior year was like the nicest  thing ever _

Yeah it was and like no one really like enforced the whole junior license thing so even if like _

If _

oh _

I would just drive alone everywhere  like no one cause like it was just wasn't enforced but it was so nice like cause also we had like the senior privilege which is like during um  you could just leave campus during your free periods _

Oh my gosh yeah off campus _

Yeah you get you can like go out for food _

that was literally the best _

or just like well anytime during your free lunch bridge you can just leave campus _

Yeah _

and like  It was  so nice _

that's what we did all the time senior year _

just like driving to like anera or something _

Yeah I know my friend would literally just like he'd like pile us on in his like little Chevy bowl and we'd all drive to like  a burger place _

with my friends _

yeah _

or we we would go into like downtown like am Matteo which is like where our school is near and we'd get like full on like ramen meals _

Yea _

mhm _

there was like this really good burger place _

oh my god _

 _

What was it called  it was called like  I've I forget the name of the burger place but it was really really good  and we just get like all this really good food _

Yeah _

all the time and I went really broke and gained a lot of weight it was great _

yeah me too it was just so nice just like being able to like leave and just get away from everythin and like  like forget that like you're stuck in this  building _

Well second semester senior year is just like  it's just like a nonstop vacation honestly _

Yeah  yeah that's true that's true like second semes- second semester's just like whatever but first semester is actually really hard for me like it was just so much _

First semester was rough _

It was _

cause I was like I was applying to this place _

yeah and college apps and also like just so much homework _

I was applying to Tufts _

I had so much homework _

There was a lot of work yeah _

 _

And I was like what the hell like everyone said senior year is supposed to be fun and easy but like it didn't get _

econd semester is _

it didn't get fun for me until like February _

Yeah what did you do like ED or did you do _

no _

no _

you did regular _

regular _

o you're like done with your applications by February _

December f-  thirty first is when I finished  cause I promised myself I'm not taking college apps in twenty eighteen _

 _

Yeah _

Yeah _

that was a good idea _

but then even then like I was like a yearbook editor and like I my schools yearbook is like hardcore _

That's that sounds stressful yeah _

Like it's hard core and we had like so many deadlines to meet  and like _

 _

I was _

yearbook is tough it demands a lot _

Yeah  and like my advisers is very like he like expects a lot from us just cause like  our book is so like well known everything so it's like you can't like slack off _

mm _

and like a few _

What was it called _

Um it's called lance _

Lance okay _


I may have I honestly may have heard of that cause my  I did journalism _

But _

Are you serious _

and  uh in senior year and like our teacher was also the yearbook teacher _

oh my god _

and she knew like a lot of different yearbooks and stuff like that  I don't know  _

I've heard of some  it sounds like really vaguely familiar I don't know _

You've heard of your _

oh My god maybe if I'll like show you _

Maybe yeah _

like _

Yeah maybe a little bit yeah  uhm  yeah and like  it was just like so demanding and like if you like slack off then you're like it's not even just like oh like if you slack off it it affects you like it affects everyone _

you'll show me a later yeah _

mhm We yeah no it it yeah it's a lot _

Yea _

it's definitely like a very demand like  _

yeah _

My friend was like one of the big editors on it and she even in second semester was like really stressed all the time _

Yeah I literally would like spend all my free time just like  editing spreads _

Yeah _

and just like yeah _

I dropped panish second semester senior year and it was the best decision of my life _

I didn't even take panish I was gonna take A panish but it was the same like  like block as A art  and like not taking A art wasn't an option for me like I'd  I wanted to take it _

mhm _

so I didn't even take panish during my senior year _

Yeah I just made sure to take like the chillest classes in second semester _

mhm _

and it it was worth it _

oh my god Every other day I like every day I had like one lunch period but every other day I had like  one class  and then a free period  two classes lunch  two classes free period one class and then I'd go home  so it was like I would do like very minimal work and then get like forty five minutes just chill and do nothing _

Oh my gosh _

Like every other like that was every other day and it was just so amazing _

Yeah there were like there was like one day I think it was honestly Fridays where  we could just go off campus and because like most of us had a free period we'd just like stay off campus _

like  There was this guy's apartment that we just went to and we would just like play video games up there for like straight up like two hours _

Yeah _

Yeah  this girl I know she had like  cause you have nine periods a day she like three four five six all free at the same time _

oh my gosh _

like  All together so she would like go home and like take a nap _

 _

That sounds amazing _

and like just like she have like two hours to herself _

Yeah I would just like wait I would wake up late on like  multiple days _

like all the time and just like drive to school like in an hour later than I was supposed to because of free period and everything _

mm _

I had A chem first period every day _

it was  The nicest thing _

 _

o _

 _

Okay that's not so fun _

yeah eight AM A chem and like the reason they have like very year it's always first periood just so like you can get it over with _

Yeah I I do like the idea of getting it over with _

cause like it's  it's  yeah like if it was ninth period I would absolutely die _

 I would be dead at that point _

is  Just  too much _

That's just really rough _

cause like that class like kills your soul _

I'm so glad our schedule is like  built in the in the way it is in college _

Yeah _

it's like _

like I like being in like control of my own time and being able to like choose when I do things _

mm _

and when I don't do things _

Yeah it's like  I don't know on Tuesdays and Thursdays it's like kind of a rough day but I between my first class and my second class there's straight up three hours _

mhm _

where I can just like Chill and do homework _

Yeah _

yeah like I like  nine thirty was like earlier than I because I wanted to start at ten thirty _

I'm starting at ten thirty every single day _

I wish like Mondays I start at one thirty _

 _

Really _

Yeah _

I'd take like I'd take a nine thirty as opposed to a ten thirty if it meant I could sleep until one thirty on like Tuesdays or something _

Yeah it's it's nice cause like Monday's I start late and then Fridays I end early  and like it's hard like waking up at nine thirty but like it's m- it's not like eight thirty like it's manageable still _

 _

Yeah if they're I I'm I made sure not to take any Friday classes and not to take any eight thirties _

Yeah I wasn't gonna take a Friday class but like it just happened I like my panish class was on a Friday  which is fine cause like it's just nine thirty to ten twenty so like after that I'm fine _

and like _

And then you're free for the day _

Yeah like normally look on Fridays I would probably like wake up at ten thirty anyway so the fact that I'm done by ten twenty like it's it's so manageable _

I mean I w- I sleep till noon on Fridays I don't know about you but _

I just I've already come back from panish and I get breakfast and then I go back to bed  and then I wake up at like noon _

 _

That sounds perfect _

Yeah it's amazing _

 _

Yeah I don't know I need to _

 _

I need to like probably better optimize my time just a little bit  cause I'm not I'm definitely not getting the right amount of sleep right now _

Yea _

and I'm not like  Doing the right amount of work _

I I could be I just like don't like _

like it it's just it's just _

It's a lot there's a lot to think about _

It's just me like procrastinating on my homework like this week I've been getting better at it  like I've been like doing my work early but I save my work for like the day before it's due and it's just like _

 _

Yeah _

I've bene just like not good at like _

Okay 
and it' s like a  maller amount of  people so we have more concentrated 
Yeah 
But it's been a  it was definitely a rough transition at first but 
That yeah must be so hard 
yeah It wasn't  wasn't very fun  but kind of adjusting into it now which is  nice 
Okay that's good 
yeah 
what do you do it like during your training 
 
Um  variety of things so  a lot of it's like kind of like classroom stuff 
Okay 
so like you'd if  you just memorize bunch of stuff about like the military the professional knowledge 
mhm 
things like that  and then  it's more like  then we do of course with the physical stuff which is just like we run around a bunch and  do like calisthenics and stuff like that 
Yeah 
but Yeah that's  that's pretty much it just the early like wake up and then  of course we have to present ourselves in like a military way 
right 
with like the  perfect uniform like 
Yeah 
Which gets to be really stressful 
I know sometimes I see people like walking on campus with that 

And we had to like read something and then write these responses and like post them on Canvas 
and it was like such like a low key like assignment it was like for every reading we had to do one 
mhm 
mhm 
but it stressed me out so much cause like you have to like respond to other people's and it has to be really Good and  Yeah  so  anxiety  can Canvas is associated with anxiety 

mhm 
 
um  that art history major course which I did not realize was  an art history major course  um and then intro to psych 
 
nice 
which I really like 
but  we'll see there could be other things as well 
Yeah 
 
but yeah 
 
um  I have one piece of advice if you think you like psychology 
mhm 
and you might want to major in it  you should like take  um the required classes  that like might overlap with other fields that you'd be interested in as soon as possible 
Okay 
 
You know 
alright yeah 
like you don't have to like dive into all the like psych  major requirements 
Yeah 
like if you're not sure but like there's a lot of things that overlap between similar things and you could start with those 
 
That is good advice 
 
Thank you thank you very much 
 
but yeah no uh  I don't any classes you recommend taking 
 
I don't know um  I'd like in like  my favorite classes are ones  that have like a lot of prerecs like for my major 
Yep 
and so it's really annoying because like  You have to like be in the major to take it 
Yep 
 
Um  I took genetics last semester 
mhm 
If you're at all like a science person that was a really cool class 
Yeah 
 
um it was hard though but it was cool 
 
yeah 
Yeah I don't know 
I'd take that 
 

Kind of  always been involved in like  the sciences 
Yeah 

oh my god 
For like a year Winchester high school 
 
That's so funny 
Did you go to Winchester high school 

okay 
that's why um 
some of my friend did he might know 
okay 
 
yeah 
 
I know I like  live in Winchester but I like didn't go to school there so I'd like a fake resident and like  it's so funny because like my friend they close friend of mine in colleges from Winchester 
No 
mhm 
 
and then we were like  how  people can look so familiar but like  what we  there's no way we would know eac h other 
yeah 
like so weird and so we must have just like seem to the like a round  town like 
robably yeah 
And high school or something like I I didn't know him at all  but yeah we hung out of the summer and he's like showing the other like  the places w here the Winchester kids like would go 

 
Um so like they're friends of mine lived like in like Lexington and Arlington 
mhm 
and stuff but not really Winchester  not too many 
 
oh 
yeah 
 
I feel like most of the people in Winchester wind up going to  to private schools or like scattered around 
Yeah 
 
because I  most of the people that like I've interacted with I went to a boarding school and most people that I interacted with there  were like  from Winchester 
 
really 
mainly from like day students 
oh weird 
yeah that was strange but uh  it was it was definitely kind of cool to think of the different towns in the way that work 

ometimes I get 
Yeah sometimes um  like I'll go home to study 
mhm 
like I went home during finals and I was like really helpful  cause like it just like locked myself in a room and like  not contact with anyone 
oh yeah 

yeah 
which is nice 
 
that is that is nice 
yeah 
Dewick is nice but  it gets old after awhile 

oh yeah 
like at schools um  but it's just like gets old after a while 
Yeah  I mean like they they do an amazing job like 
Right 
With food but like I feel like just like the atmosphere like 
Yeah 
mm coming there every single day is like ugh 
no 
again 
Definitely 
 
yeah 
 
Hodgins a nice change of pace though 
 
Yeah  I like it 
I'm still trying to figure out like all the best places to eat 
 
I know yeah you have to have like your special at each  and each place 
oh yeah 
 
I've been I've been  absolutely wasting money at the tower though getting sushi 
 
oh really 
yeah 
I've have never had sushi there 
It's pretty good 
Okay 
Well it's like market basket sushi 
but like 
okay 
 
Interesting 
Tides you over 
yeah 
yeah 
it's good study s- study snack 
Yeah 
 
oh yeah have you found a good study place on campus 
 
uh Kind of I mean  when I really have like a lot of work to do I just kinda buckle down in my room  but uh 
Okay 
 
Go to the library sometimes and then  I love the top of the library and like when it's really nice 
mm 
It's so nice 
yeah just like bundle up and  start reading on the top or something like that 
Yeah 
but 
 
Other than that not really 
Yeah I feel like I never really took advantage of like Tisch roof when it was warm enough 
mhm 
to like actually sit out there  but it's so nice 
It is absolutely beautiful  and like  it's not doesn't have to always be like the sunset sunrise 
Right 
like just looking out at the skyline is so cool 
it's just nice  yeah 
 
That's true 
ch- 
feel like you're on top of the world top of the hill 
Yeah 
 
oh I feel like you're like  want water or something 
I know 
 
god all this talking 
 
But it did say some light refreshments were gonna be Included 
True right where are they 
I don't know 
 
maybe that would like interfere with our  like  body language or something 
yeah 
 
that could 
 
yeah 
Yeah 
 
I wonder if like we're gonna be compared like to  other other groups  [] as well 
I yeah I don't know 
 
be like oh like this person and like  Horrible body language 
weird 
Yeah right like oh they clearly hate each other like  okay  
 
I don't know  I like once read this cool thing about how  like you know how there's like people that are like really charismatic 
Yep 
and like get along with other people really well 
 
They're like  like one of the reasons I guess that they can do that is cause they like match their like for voice frequency like well to others 
really 
like it I guess yeah when you like are talking to someone you like match their like speaking pattern in a way 
mhm 
and like people that are like  connect really well with others like can like match it better or something 
hm 
 
it seemed really cool  yeah 
that's interesting 
I know right 
 
yeah I I should do kind of wonder like what makes people like good with people skills 
Yeah 
and stuff like that 
it's like it's weird yeah 
 
yeah 
 
hm 
 
cause you think everyone's kind of like  pretty basically like standard 
but then there's some people who are just like so  good at like  s- connecting with people 
Yeah 
and like what is it 
Yep 
you know 
ometimes I feel like it's just like excessive like  like energy  
Yeah 
yeah true 
 
what you mean it like that definitely rubs off on people  
it's like 
Yeah 
 
That's fair 
You love having that person that just makes your day 
Yeah yeah  definitely 
 
but Yeah I mean those that was really cool thing like just sitting back and watching during orientation 
mhm 
like how everybody interacted 
Yeah 
And it's like  you see the people who are like trying incredibly hard to like  to make connections and then there's the people that the subtle connections like 
mhm 
 
that don't  that aren't so overt about their  about their intentions and stuff like  that 
Yeah I know  did you know anyone coming to tufts 
I knew actually a fair amount of people 
Okay 
um 
 
Just like basically from like high school and  and uh  you know  people around 
Yeah 
in the surrounding areas that wound up going to Tufts 
mhm 
I don't know It's like they're all trying to help me you know 
Yeah 
Transition 
 
That's nice 
And then they're a bunch of kids uh 
 
Of course I knew the lacrosse team like coming in 
Right 
And then I'd  do a couple kids that I graduated with  and u h  yeah it was nice having like familiar faces 
so wasn't like absolute reset but 
mhm 
Yeah exactly I yeah I guess also being part of a team that like makes a huge difference 
cause They have like a group of people 
Yeah 
no definitely 
There 
but then we like I don't know I just feel like kind of 
 
I like  pressured to lik kinda pressured to like be part of that like team image 
Right yeah 
I don't know I didn't really want that coming out of the gate kinda wanted just do my own things 
Yeah yeah 
 
yeah 
yeah 
The athlete section at Dewick 

 
And then like even when I was a classics I was close to like my captains I'm still in touch with them 
 
And actually I sort of basically now  my class six captains of about six email as 
Mm 
 
I'm my elder brothers friends some of them 
oh 
o like I still see them and like you know it's the two of them 
Okay yeah 
we like to lobe my brothers friends sometimes so 
 
You chill with your  brothers friends when you were in class six and they were in class twelve 
No no  no I didn't chill with them at that point I chill with them now 
Okay okay 
Like for the last  two years one or two years 
yeah 
 
I that's why I was like clearly small  but like  also he was in boarding school at that point and he was not here and her was not at home  and plus he was in college 
Hm 
so that used the hardly shopping but even as a kid I used to sit with them so like  that was his brother's friends  like my brother's friend 
Yeah 
they used to play risk 
 
What 

They used to play a game called risk 
what is that 

and like 
the lot of soldiers 
 
I knew is Nicole conquer territories  so  like you just like so basically what they used to do it like one of them  used to cheat 
 
Mm 
so he used to just stuck his soldiers  randomly and then you know the like  we're gonna misplaced  access so that had on the side  so ice who them windows cheating  and it's gonna be so much fun cause I knew that he was going to cheat 
 
so i used tto sit with him  even that time but like I didn't get what they were saying or what they were doing because I was really small 
 
Cute 
 
Because he's like six years older than me so 
 
wait how come your brother went to boarding school is that a thing in your  family for like the boys to go to boarding school  
No 
cause it's like that in like many  many families I know 
No no so like my brother went to a boarding school because he was an   before 
 
and 
what is that 

it's my  nanny's school 
 
Oh 
 
o my mom tell you a special attention and she didn't want that because  like you know  so nice 
 
Mm 
so that's why 
I feel that 
o that's way like she that that's why he went to boarding school no so wouldn't do IB because he didn't like though CBE board 
 
Mm 
so that's why he went in  nine 
I don't think anybody likes to CV people  this is do it 
 
Yeah like he found them more difficult than the IB 
 
he found CB more difficult 

Because 
not more difficult residing much better than IB because he thinks logically in CV you need to more up 
yeah true  happens 
o like he did much better in the IB  and  my younger brother's probably not going to boarding school because  he's too spoiled 
 
ame 
and also like  he's proobably not going because  he them entertaining and out  of my desktop and so on this and him also 
Yeah  when my younger brother so was spoiled you have no idea he's not been to school twelve days right now  cause a slight fever  my parents used to send me to school with hundred and two fever also 
 
yeah no I used to decide whether I wanted to go to school or not 
Yeah but like I used to decide to go to school with fever also  because  like you know the for the played with my brother locked  pisses me off so much 
 
No I I never went to school I used to find excuses not to go to school  but no like  It depended like 
I used to love school 
 
most of like the class Dan I guess it was good regularly eleven because like it's a waste of time have so much work I'd rather stay and do the work 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 
o like eleven today so months with it but but not too much 
 
Even I mountain twelve 
 
But not too much because I should are our had woken school as one would like  with the different activities 
that there was always something going on so when there was something going on we couldn't long  and I could only bank when  like can nice sometimes walk I no longer than the deal for this is what the day before 
Hm 
 
oh we weren't allowed to bunk the day before a test 
Or even we weren't allowed but like like you know I actually used to fall asleep because so much pressure 
actually used to fall asleep with the pressure 
Oh 
 
and I used to fall and I wouldn't go to school or sometimes nice isn't just a bout so we weren't allowed to bunk the  week before exams  so I used to so walk bank 
The whole week 

Yup  s- like before like finals of awful if you weren't allowedto bunk the previous week 

Yeah 
When I lived I used to go to the north  on Monday the week before finals 
 

 

 
how  how many children does she have 
 
Oh 
 
Why does she have so many rooms in her house then 
she has two sons who have  children 
 
Yeah but  when 
 
her sons were were going up and stuff  then  like  it wouldn't make sense to have like a five bedroom house for four people 
not five bedroom 
There were like three upstairs 
There two ups- 
there are three upstairs 
Oh I didn't see the third one 
 
Mm 

 
oh I don't know I have no idea 
 
yeah 
 
urprising 
 
yeah I feel bad that I left the food though 
 
Hm 
 
I thought she was coming to the garden to say bye I feel really bad about not saying bye  she was so nice to me 
 
I think she was feeling sick 
 
yeah  like I think she was going to but then I was leaving 
yeah 
 
But also the route uh  that it was showing today was different than the one last night  so I think the one today's the one she was talking about 
 
Oh man 
 
cause  uh last night it was showing from her house to Boston to tufts 
I don't think so 
but  this was showing from her house straight to Tufts  it wasn't crossing Boston 
Mhm 
I don't know 
I have no idea 
yeah I check 
 
Yeah 
 
hm 
You can check the  go bus 
 
mm yeah 
if you want to like 
 
but I can't change it now already done 
 
mm that's fine it's not that bad 
 
Yeah 
um also go bus has so many stops and the car doesn't have any stops 
that has one stop 
 
Go bus no it has like two three three stops 
Yeah 
 
Go bus 
 
No she said  she has one stop 
Yeah 
No she said it has two three stops 
No no she said it only like  basically 
Oh no 
It's Dawson criminal he stops in Newton 

 
I don't know 
Yeah it does I looked it up from New York to Boston- sorry Boston to New York I saw it while I was in the   
 
Mm 
 
so it has  more stops and  that's kinda annoying and maybe like she's saying megabus is not nice because it's double decker  so if you go to like go sit on the top deck that goes something that's still nice but 
 
I will sit on the top deck it's not bad at all 
 

contagious cough 
How do they clean these microphones 
 

 
They probably have some spray  and it's probably just like very concentrated 
I just feel bad cause if we're coughing all up on this

microphone and then somebody else gets it just like in their mouth 
antibacterial 
 
You  you just coughed on it directly when I said that 

 

That was a close call 
did your alarm go off 
mhm 
 
I think I heard your alarm go off 
 
I  think so  our alarm system is very 
 
weird 
  my live's just a 
your alarm's a-  your alarm system is whack 
mhm 
 
It's like o  funny 
it's just 
I'm just like so  asleep that I won't wake up 
You're a very Very deep sleeper 
till one 
to One  so I gotta put on  at least three 
And they're not e- like 
 
They're all like the worst possible alarm sounds 
and I still don't get up 
 
that's insane  
 
Oh my  god 
What is 
 
At least it's not like Do you remember last year  
Happeninin 
 
When like you're like beeping one would go off 
 
And then I would go to the bathroom 
and then it would keep beep- and I would have to get up but like I didn't know how to turn it off 
you just like threw the alarm clock at the door 
I was like kept pressing buttons and then eventually it would stop  but then sometimes I  also hit snooze  so then I would get back in bed and then it'd go off again  honestly I normally just unplugged it 
 
And then I wouldn't notice and that's why  I probably wouldn't get up the next day  we'll just leave it at that 
 
that's so full that hard even if you unplug it   
 it's weird 
Really 
 
mhm 
 
For like  a couple hours and then it goes away 
 
That's so weird 
 
mhm 
how do they do that 
 
mm 
 
it's very first 
plus my times wrong  it's like two minutes 
 
Fixe it 
behind 
 
I'm too lazy 
 
mhm 
 
I know I always think that's it's like good for me to be behind but It's better to be ahead 
 
Yeah then it just makes you late to everything 
 
it really does 
 
I should put it two minutes ahead 
 
I heard that 
Or you can set it to the real time 
 
That's just a thought though 
What good would that do 
 
I don't know  then you would know what time it is 
 
Can you see under this  cause I wore those with the 
Under where 

 

 

 

 
sad 
 
Very  and that toaster like  is that from the school 
 or did someone bring it 
I don't know  I don't know  but nobody knows how to use it  so 
 
there's no directions either  so 
Also like the microwave you know how like Reina accidentally like 
 
Exploded omething in there 
No no no that was like the worst hand motion for 
 
he like shattered 
 
The  the like plate at the bottom of the microwave 
she did 
dude my eyes burn so bad um 
 
Yeah like accidentally  but she like shattered it 
That's gross 
And 
 
and like didn't tell Emma 
Is that  where it  shoot  or 
 
I feel like 
someone was like where's the glass plate  
 
Yeah I feel like  Reina didn't know it was Emma's either  
mm mm 
 
I really thought it came with the school 
Wow thank god for that microwave cause otherwise I could not have my 
 
Dyno nuggets 
 
mhm 
 
I honestly really love the waffle maker  little mini egg 
Good for egg 
Also 
 
Really excited to see this house today 
 
Oh shit you're goin' on a house tour 
The one on Whitfield 
 
What which one is that? 

Come at three  fifteen 
Which one is-  dude I don't think I can 
 
I'm gonna drag both of my parents 
 
Is that the 

 
it's on wif- it's 
 
Like right 
 
Next to Lewis like if you go across the bridge and keep going it's like on that street 
what bridge are you talking about 

 
There's like Hodge and there's like a Lewis bridges it's just like a random walkway  it's like a bridge 
 
There's just like nothing underneath  definition of a bridge 
You mean like the-  you just mean Lewis right? 

Yeah 
okay word 
 
I need to sneeze 
 
Don't do it  don't do it 
 
It's gonna hurt  if I keep it in 
 
You can do it 
 
But that's a good location 
 
that is a good locat-  is that the four person one 
mhm 
 
and I  don't think nine hundred's too bad but that's six person one with the pool 
 
okay I don't know if that's gonna happen or not though  he was like they have an open house for that today 
 
ew  it feels like you're coughing into my ear 
 
hey 
 
But  they have an open house for it today but like I asked if he was like sure that it was available for like the time we need it 
 
mhm 
And he was like I'm somewhat sure like I'll let you know as soon as I find out 
 
and like I'm not trying to go to the open house 
mm mm 
and also like if it is not as cheap as I think it is 
 
How  would it not be 
 
It might not be  I don't know dude it has a pool which is super unnecessary 
 
but also doesn't raise the hi-  price of the house 
I feel like it would 
Right 
I feel it would be more expensive 
mhm 
 
maybe we're not allowed to use it 
 
No it says 
 
pool for those hot summer days  so I feel like it's not just to like be there 
 
that's fair 
 
I don't know I want him to hit me back and be like it's available and it's this cheap 
 
It's not a lie  and it's  close to Davis or closer in that direction 
 
It's in  it's more like if you just from the bottom of Tufts went  sideways 
 
mm 
 
Does that make any sense 
 
it's like  I'm picturing near the round about now 
 
Yeah it's like if from the round about you went  like 
 
Away from tufts  but not  downwards towards Davis like to the right 
like towards the pub 
 
I don't know dude 
 
mm 
 
it's on Harvard street 
 

 
Okay I thought it was like 
Continuity perspective 
Yeah its definitely like for like controls 
 
but like 
oh yeah 
it's kinda sus because it makes us look like a mirror cause I think this window like looks weird 
 
Maybe it's just cause it's really like clean 
Maybe they could make it a  like  one right mirror  or a two way mirror  like they could  have different effects on it it's high tech 
 
Hi tech 

Thing 
 
Bullshit like why do you give me like coupon  things oh 
 

 
I just remembered that I was like maybe you have to scan that first  
 
tupid 
I bet CV Doesn't Trust you 
why don't they give you those instructions 
 
Oh  they better trust me 
 
I also didn't really Know that 
I'm a loyal consumer 
 
I went to like use coupons and then I like  called someone over and I was like hey the coupons aren't working and they were like okay you have to like scan your CV card and I was like no like I have these coupons 
 
they were like you need to scan the CV card for it to work and I was like I don't have a  CV card with me and then he just scanned his and I was like thanks 
 

but it's like 
Yeah mm 
 
I took the composition for film class instead because 
A lot of work 
Yeah that's at that one I mean I'm not a film person but that does sound cool 
Yeah  I'm not really a film person either but I like writing music so 
Okay 
that's the  that's the whole class basically 
Yeah that's so neat 
Yeah 
 
Yeah like the music is culture class we just had an exam and I'm just like 
 
Really 
It was not 
 
o you have to keep up with the readings and stuff 
ah 
ooo 
so studying for that was a pain 
 
Yeah that's a tough one 
Yeah 
 
I feel like  with psych with the keeping up for the readings it  takes forever 
I know I can't I'm still on chapter nine 
I just started chapter nine 
It's like  I can't I only did I'm on nine one  and I like read the first like nine one a  but like part B is so long I just gave up on it 
Yeah 
 
Are you interested in s- like  studying psych or like what are you interested in 
I wasn't before 
kinda just took it on a whim 
Yeah 
Yeah I'm planning on majoring in applied mathematics and quantitative econ 
 
oh Cool 
But  I'm not taking any math classes which is a problem 
 
What's game theory though 

Game theory is an economics class 
Okay 
um I thought it was gonna be a math class but I can probably 
 
Try to get it to count for the math 
 
mhm 
 
Um I'll fight for it 
 
Yeah 
 
Yeah 
There were like no math classes available when I was when my  during my registation time 
I couldn't get in any of them I was too late 
 
Yeah 
yeah 
When was your time 
 
think twelve forty five 
oh you were later than me I was a twelve fifteen I think 
Yeah so like every class was filled up when I looked at it 
Yeah 
 
that was nice 
 
Yeah  I hopefully next semester is different 
 
or like In two weeks whenever we register 
I hope 

Damn  yeah 
It's so weird that it's like November  I don't like it 
 
I'm not a huge fan either 
Are you doing anything for Halloween 
 
Um  I had a little bit of fun last night 
 
Okay 
Um  probably  have a little more fun tonight  I have a comedy show tonight 
 
oh that's fun 
so that's fun 
that is fun 
Yeah  it's an open Mic but 
Where is that 
It's in hotung  which is in the campus center 
Okay 
 
cool 
Yeah  it's exciting out outside of that not doing much tonight 
 
Yeah 
 
Yeah which psych class are you in 
 
I'm in the twelve o'clock one 
I'm also in that one 
 
There's so many people in it 
There's too many people I keep meeting new people from it and I'm like really you're in this class 
 
it's so many people you just blend in 
Even worse was when I found out that guys live across the hall from me  are in that class and sit in the rowbehind me 
uhuh 
Really 
Like every class and I 
Where do you sit in the room 
like  closer to the front ish 
Okay 
uh Like two like second or third row 
Okay I'm always in the  back  left  I don't know why  I always I'm like the last one there  I like never get front 
that helps no it's not a psychological reason 
No 
 
I don't think so 
 
Yeah  that's exciting  I don't know  I kinda like the way that class is taught 
 
Yeah 
oh and they're 
I like how it's both of them 
Yeah 
 
they're both so cool 
 
Because I feel like I'd get tired of it if it was the same person every day lecturing me the same way 
 
Yeah 
Like it keeps us off balance it's nice 
 
Yeah definitely 
and they lecture so differently which is nice too 
I now  it's the videos the other day were so funny 
yeah 
 
that helps  every time they show the office I'm like have you seen that episode 
they were 
 
I haven't seen the office 
 
it's worth watching 
I've watched 
 
It's worth I just started it like two weeks ago 
I want to watch it  but I just like don't have time 
 
Yeah 
It'll be a summer thing 
ee I watched like one episode a day  so I'm 
oh 
 
Maybe two 
And they're quick right they're like twenty minutes 
And  there's t- twenty minute episodes yeah 
Yeah 
Um  I think one of the seasons has all forty minute episodes but it's half the amount of episodes 
Okay 
o 
 
I don't know why they did that 
 
Yeah that's weird 
But 
To change it up 
 
No it's a good show  cause all my other  um shows that I was quote unquote binging  um  ended  so 
 
oh okay 
or I finished them already 
 
ohh 
o that helps I had been anyone 
Yep  the office I've I've heard nothing but good things about it 
Yeah 
 
I just like don't 
I haven't had any bad experience with it yet 
Yeah I just don't usually watch like  co- like funny shows 
 
what do you watch usually 
I'm 
I like crime shows 
oo 
 
and like  that sort of thing 
 
like law and order kind of thing 
Yeah like law and order like criminal minds 

those  those are cool shows 
They're cool they're weird sometimes 
 
most the time  yeah it's well done though 
Yeah 
yeah they do a good job with it 
VU is a really good 
 
Never watched VU  people tell me to I've never done it never actually gone through with it 
It's a good show 
 
I'll have to check it out 
If you ever have time 
 
I only have time for one episoode a day of the office  so 
 
That's what happened on VU 
 
And then pretend that's still part of the same episode of the office 
Yeah 
see if it matches up 
exactly 
 
Testing 
 
ugh 
Yeah 
 
mostly just too tired to do things now 
 
I know  I always nap it's so bad I like never get work done 
I didn't wake up till one today 
Yeah 
 
Threw me off 
We had to I'm on the soccer team we had to wake up 
oo 
 
For practice otherwise I wouldn't have gotten out of bed 
 
Yeah I looked outside like when I woke up I'm like is it really one oclock it's kinda dark 
 
It's just like today was one of those days where you can't really do anything 
 
Yeah  that made sense 
It's just too gross out 
 
tried to go to the gym but  when I got there I was soaked so like it ruined the whole gym experience 
ugh Like when your shoes are wet 
 
My shoes are soaked right now 
You can't do anything 
It's terrible 
 
I just reali- I forgot that I packed my rain boots so I just pulled 'em out today 
 
Really 
Yeah 
 
I don't have rain boots  I do have a contact that's hurting but that's okay 
oh no 
It'll be fine  it happens like  when I get rainwater in my eye 
 
You know typical things 
I know  my g-  ay  my contacts  I wear contacts too  they're a lifesaver 
I hate when I hate glasses 
Yeah 
 
I hate glasses too  but I have 'em in case  I need them 
Yeah 
yeah 
 
One day I forgot to take my contacts out at night 
 
oh 
And I woke up my eyes were like totally bloodshot 
I hate that 
 
o when I took my contacts out like  I just started like with my glasses on 
mhm 
I went downstairs and someonoe was like  are you okay like they thought I was like really in really bad shape I'm like no I just didn't take my contacts out overnight but like  people were looking at me really funny all day 
Yeah 
I t was like  are you are you good  like my teacher pulled me aside after class 
oh no 
and asked me if I was um doing okay I'm like yeah I just  it's not that big a d-  it's fine 
just forgot my contacts 
 
Yeah 
No I like I've done that before and then I wake up and I'm like oh I can see now and then  and then it's a disappointment when I would like have to take them out 
 
hmm 
 
What happens 
I hate it 
 
It's a miracle 
I know 
 
Yeah  I don't know  contacts are annoying but better than glasses 
Yes 
Yeah 
like I just hate Wallich you can't see everything with glasses 
 
it's the peripheral vision that's thrown off 
Yeah  and like when I'm like especially when I'm going downstair- like walking downstairs with them on 
oh Yeah 
 
cause then I- 
they shake a little bit ansd said 
Yeah and like I'll see  through my glasses and then I'll also see like 
 
with my glasses off like 
Yeah like 
When I looked down down like I can't see anything it's just blurry 
You'll see like just below anything at  it's awful 
Then I get thrown off 
 
Even worse so like before I wore contacts like the glasses made sense but now that I've worn contacts f- for a good amount of time now When I put the glasses on everything is like  so different 
Yeah 
Yeah like you can't go back 
Yeah  I do every once in a while because I have to 
It's a weird 
 
mhm 
But like 
 
It's so weird 
Yeah  it's like getting your eyes a break or whatever they say but like I  I'm like no  that's not happening 
Yeah it's  it is what it is 
 
Yeah 
Yeah even worse is like when you go a couple days in a row where you've like stayed up too late and wear the contacts for a long period of time 
Yeah 
And then like your eyes are just generally bloodshot 
I know 
It's awful 
 
And I hate the like the dry feeling 
 
Yeah 
Like when you keep them in and it's just like they kind of get like stuck to your eye 
Yeah yeah 
 
It sucks 
 
One time I  um tried to take my contact out my contact must have fallen out though so like I'm just pulling out my eye for like thirty minutes 
oh no 
I was like panicking because I was at a concert so like I got home and I went to take them Out  I just didn't have one of them in they were just must have fallen out 
that's so funny 
The scariest part is that I drove home  like I drove home with only one contact in and don't even notice 
That's so weir- is there what's your prescription  is it that 
 
it's not that bad but I have like a really bad astigmatism 
uh huh 
 
so 
Okay 
 
I should noticed  it would've thrown me off 
but I don't know 
That's funny 
I I didn't notice 
 
Yeah I couldn't do that my eyes are too bad 
 
Yeah 
 
I like 
Happens 
I wanna get Lazic but  it scares me 
It was a little scary 
it's a lil s- 

utting lasers in yeah 
I know  I'm  way too scared not till I'm  way older 
 
Yeah  I was scared of contacts forever if I contact like six months like 
oh really 
I had like an enormous  unnecessary fear for like poking my eyes 
That's so i- interesting 
um Like I had nothing to cause the fear 
Uh huh 
I just had that fear 
 
That's so weird 
Uhm but  then I was like fuck it I'll get contacts  and that's definitely on video 
 
Like the con  it's like the conditioning  or whatever 
yeah finishing 

Yeah 
yeah 
That's so funny  I got it when I was like 
 
Ten 
Nine or ten  cause I needed 'em for soccer cause like I couldn't 
Yeah I should on that 
my makes sense 
I didn't want to wear the like goggles 
 
see I just wore the my regular glasses when I played soccer when I was younger 
uh huh 
and they would always like fall off or I'd get hit in the face the ball 
Yeah 
like I couldn't do headers like 
Yeah 
I lost a whole point of the game 
Exactly 
Actually every sport I played  a somehow at some point either break a pair of glasses or get hit in the face or like 
Yeah 
 
something always went wrong 
 
Yeah 
 
yeah 
 
that's so f- 
except for cross country I never had problems with glasses in cross country 
No 
 
do you still do are you still playing any sports 
uh no  I'm really good at getting hurt 
No 
 
What have you at what are you injured 
 
I've injured like everything you can name a bone or place in my body I've hurt it 
oh gosh really 
It's yeah  most likely doing something clumsy not even not even playing sports 
That's f- 
 
Like I had three concussions in a month once 
not good 
 
I don't play any contact sports 
 
what 
Yeah 
how 
well first one I got in choior 
 
Okay 
Um my friend accidentally hti me in the head 
oh gosh 
o it was a small one the day I came back from that concussion  someone hit me in the face with a basketball just like down like in the hall  um the day I came back from that concussion I tripped and fell hit my head on a metal pole 
 
That's such bad luck 
Yeah  it's fine I mean it's tough I couldn't have lost that much brain cells 
 
My friend  had  one and she was out of school for like two months 
Damn 
it was terrible 
 
Was a sports concussion though 

Yeah so she was heading the- she's a center back 
That makes sense 
Okay 
And she was heading the ball and like it hit her too high up  instead of on the forehead 
 
that makes sense 
And she  lost s- like it was during our junior  junior year  of high school  and she couldn't play  or she couldn't she stopped playing after she got the concussion  cause she was too afraid  and then  she like it affected all her like ACTs ATs and like all of our classes 
Yeah 
 
that's awful 
 
he made it to Duke so I think she's doing okay 
I think she's doing fine 
Doesn't really matter 
yeah 
 
It worked out 
 
at least it worked out 
 
Injuries suck though 
 
Yeah I hate getting injured 
 
Yeah  I'm sca- I've been  knock on wood I've been fortunate enough not to have 
is this wood 
 
I don't even know  not to have major stuff but like even like little injuries I've had a concussion before 
 
Yeah 
But 
 
none of my c- my three concussions were major so like 
Yeah 
I was out of school for like a week each 
uh huh 
 
um but the three in a row was what the problem was 
Yeah  that sets you back a lot 
yeah 
 
it's okay it was my freshman year so I was I didn't have that much to do 
oh 
that's not bad 
Yeah 
 
Are you doing any like  other activities 
 
um 
at school 
 
I tried to do acapella 
 
Okay 
Didn't get in 
 
okay 
Um try to do the cheap socks  didn't get into that 
What 

it's improv 
what's that 
 
it's improv 
oh okay 
 
um so now I'm in comedy 
 
Cool 
um which is I guess the third tier  thing 
Yeah that's so fun 
so  yeah 
 
o cool 
it's exciting 
 
Yeah 
is it like new for you or have you done comedy before 
I'm 
I've done comedy before just it's been a while 
 
uh huh 
Like  I did comedy when I was like thirteen 
Okay 
and like before I had any idea of what was actually funny 
 
Yeah 
um o now it's  different like I'm writing jokes like all the time 
uh huh 
now cause it's just finally I'll think of something funny and I'll write it down where as before I wouldn't think to write that down I would just like 
Yeah 
Think of something funny 
 
That's so fun 
that's so interesting 
o 
 
yeah  even better is when I actually have the tell the jokes  um because sometimes I'll just write down a  a key word 
Yeah 
like a  like a word that if anyone read it like they would have no idea what I possibly mean by that 
Yeah 
and then sometimes I'll forget what they mean 
Uh huh 
and it ruins the whole joke  I'll just be like  binoculars I don't know that joke is  like 
Is it like scripted when you do it or is it more 
ome of it's scripted  mostly not though it's mostly like I've written like part of a joke  down  and I'll like no matter how I tell it that's the joke is 
Okay 
 
I try to write as little as possible down so I can like consolidate space 
uh huh 
 
Um but other jokes have to be scripted because I can't be told otherwise 
Yeah so like tonight when you go to the thing will you  like  have a set like something like prepared for it or is it more just like you'll go up there and 
I'm gonna try to  I'm gonna try to do it memorized 
Okay 
um but I have a s- I have a set prepared kind of 
Yeah 
um I haven't really memorized it but I should start doing it some point 
 
In the next hour 
Or so 
Yeah I'll figure it out 
 
yeah 
 
I haven't done a show memorized yet 
mhm 
so I wanted to do one 
feel like that would be hard it's more important I feel like to get the joke down 
Yeah 
Right maybe 
I'll probably be telling jokes I've already told  tonight 
I don't know 
 
Yeah 
Um but it's a new audience so they haven't heard 'em 
That's cool 
 
Yeah 
Never heard of that here  I'll have to go sometimes is every week 
 
I don't know  um it's  this week for sure 
it's not been every week 
mhm 
 
uh you should go tonight 
 
I would but we have a team dinner thing 
that makes sense 
 
um     ports 
We have a playoff game tomorrow 
really 
o if we l-  lose our season's over  but if we win 
 
you win you get another game 
we're s- 
Yes  we get another game 

 
Yeah 
 
Which is  nerve wracking but exciting  hopefully we do well 
that works 
 
good luck 
 
Thank you 
what position do you play 
I'm a forward 
Forward okay 
I got I just got moved I was  playing outside mid all of high school and like outside back 
Okay 
 
And then  on this team I'm just  better fit up top 
 
that works 
like I like the ball at my feet 
 
And like 
that makes sense it's soccer 
kills and stuff  yeah  I'm not  like our outside minis are more runners 
Okay 
Like 
 
Yeah 
Just  can go up and back all day and chase people down and that's just not 
Yeah 
 
My  best like that's not my skill set 
Yeah I mostly played outside many when I played  soccer or goalie 
Yeah 
so 
oh goalie 
Yeah a goalie for awhile  
That's neat 
but they make uh I was in the travel team to me another better goalie 
uhuh 
from a different town who joined 
oh okay 
so I didn't play goalie after that 
Yeah 
uh cause  I cann't compete  this kids ridiculously good at goalie  he got recruited so 
oh cool 
um 
 
But I quit way before that 
 
Yeah 
 
Yeah 
How long did you play 
 
I played for like  five or six years but I quit when I was like fourteen 
oh cool 
okay 
Like just before high school 
 
Gotcha did you play any sports in high school or no 
Um  I did cross country   uhm 
Okay 
Because I'm good at getting hurt I wanted to find a sport I couldn't get hurt in 
Yeah 
I was wrong 
 
No 
Now 
oh I feel like they'd kill your body 
 
or anyone's body 
Yeah 
 
it was tougher than I thought 
 
yeah 
 
Um I was a good cheerleader though  on crutches 
 
What do you do  what you heard 
um 
 
The last time I ever did cross country um I got a stress fracture in my right foot and double shin splints 
My gosh 
so 
 
The shins ones I feel like I've heard are probably the worst thing 
yeah 
hin splints hurt  but aren't like dangers injury wise 
Yeah like they can't get worse 
just yeah 
they're not gonna get any worse 
They're just painful 
the worst that could happen 
 
Like is if you like hit your shin on something while you had shin splints 
mhm 
then you could get a fracture cause your shins are weaker 
Yep 
but it's mostly just pain 
 
mhm 
Where was this the stress factor 
so 
In my foot name is was in the um 
Okay 
 
I'm not a lateral something on my foot 
mm 
 
it was fine 
I know a lot of girls who've gotten stress fractures like from over use and that sort of thing 
 
Well yeah  um when you run every day  eventually Eventually it  hits too much in some people 
oh It's too much 
 
Yeah and our feet feet are so important 
Yeah  you know you forget how  how easy it walking is until you're like hurt 
 
Yeah 
like I- 
 
at the time like I thought everything was normal and then I got hurt and I was like shit  it's so slow like I was so slow getting places 
Yeah 
I hated that like I'd be late to class and be like our I'm like I'm on crutches give me a break 
Yeah like you take it for gra- it gets taken for granted 
Yeah  I don't know it is what is 
Yeah 
 
um b- 
 
I've learned a lot from being hurt 
 
Yeah 
 
oh resilience and stuff like that 
Definitely  it's a big  it's very important 
 
I've learned how to quit things that I can't do without getting hurt 
 
mhm 
 
like cross country 
 
Cross country 

Yeah 
I don't know  I'm n- I don't know anybody on cross country here 
 

 
Feel like there's a couple swimmers in my hole 
 
Okay 
 
a f- couple football players some basketball  basketball players 
 
kay 
 
Feel like Hill has a lot of athletes just cause it's like stays open through the winter 
Yeah 
 
That makes sense 
But I don't know 
 
eople in Hodge like cause like one of my friends across the hall plays lacrosse but his roommates on the sailing team 
Okay 
 

And um  another person down the hall is on the guys soccer team 
oh do you know his name 
Um his name is ebastian 
 

 
it's all good  there's a lot of guys  another guy it goes to the Olympics 
 
oh wow 
o  at the um  what's the thing called the  what was the first thing we did in like O week ago like welcoming us  whatever that was 
They ca- the ceremony 
Yeah that 
or matriculation 
Uh 
matriculation that's what it was  uh remember when they talked about the guy who wrote his essay about going to the olympics 

Yes 
that's that guy 
 
that's so cool 
Yeah 
 
That's so neat 
o 
Where is your who's your roommate where is he from 
My roommate is from Long Island 
 
Cool 
how bout you 
 

I'm in a  forced triple 
I was in a forced triple 
You got out of it 

No one of my roommates left  so now it's a forced triple that's actually a double 
That sound nice 
 
Yeah 
My so one of them is from Manhattan 
Okay 
And ones from eattle  so very very different 
Yeah 
or not Manhattan she's from Brooklyn 
 
Both my roommates were from around the area cause one's from omewhere in mass 
Okay 
uh huh 
I'm from connecticut my other roommates' from Long Island so we all met up in New York and went to a festival over the summer 
oh what festival 
anorama 
Okay 
it was Exciting 
That's so fun 
Got rained out 
 
oh 
Like crazy thunderstorms so 
 
That's unfortunate 
Didn't didn't get to see the weekend  or maybe or anybody I wanted to see  but that's okay 
 
Yeah another time maybe 
Yeah  it was worth it 
Maybe next summer  you guys can try again 
Next summer 

 
yeah  probably not 
Do you guys get or did it  do you get along with the one who's still there 
Yeah we 
we get along  um the one who left was still hangs out with us 
oh 
um 
Did he just  he's still at the school 

He just couldn't sleep 
 
he just he switched um dorm buildings 
oh was he in a top bunk or some- 
he just couldn't sleep 
Yeah  the other two of us aren't cause we put we put ours down 

 
Okay 
Which um means we have very little space in the room but we can sleep  so 
oh so he was  was he lofted 
Yeah 
 
Okay 
 
so 
o ours is like a lo- we have  the Hill dorms I've seen used 
hills are huge 
they're so big so the doubles are nor- like p- a- Wonderful size 
Yeah 
 
but  ours is just like  the exact same size but with three people living in it so it  feels  way smaller  so like we have  a lofted bed  with she's all our stuff underneath and then we have our bunk bed 
mhm 
and  I was the last of the rooms so on the  top of the bunkbed 
mmm 
which kind of sucks but  it's kinda cozy up there 
 
that works 
It just sucks cause I can't fold my laundry 
 
oof 
 
It's hard to do that 
Yeah  I don't  I I feel like living in Hill has a lot of benefits 
mhm 
like room size being one of them 
 
Yeah 
Like  she probably don't feel like it's that forced of a triple like there's still plenty of space in your room 
Yeah exactly like it's not like  claustrophobic by any means 
Like I can reach from  the end of my bed to the end of my  um roommates' bed 
Like  because the like 

 
like cause the way it's set up at this point  like  it's not that far it's like three feet 
mhm 
Did you get the third bed moved out 
Not yet 
 
Um because apparently you're supposed to pay for that 
 
what 
I thought that was silly but  I don't know I'm still talking with res life about it 
mhm That's ridic- 
They haven't gotten back to me 
The guy who moved out should help you out with that 
 
Yeah  we'll figure it out  um  worst case scenario we don't move it out because we've been using his storage space 
 
Okay 
 
o 
That's nice though 
not a big deal 
Yeah 
 
Worst case scenario it's nothing happens  so 
Yeah 
 
wa- we've been living fine in the first place 
mhm It works out 
Yeah  the Hills dorms are just huge 
I know 
like my friend's in a single there and her room's bigger than mine 
he's in a single 
Yeah 
 
That's so nice 
 
I wouldn't ever want to live in a single 
 
I feel like singles  I don't know  I- at least as a freshman I definitely wouldn't want to 
Yeah 
 
But  in some ways they're nice to just be like 
It's nice to have the privacy  but like you lose that already key scial output 
Yeah 
 
Yes 
 
o 
Like I feel like it's harder to make friends maybe 
 
Yeah little bit 
I don't know 
 
Not a big deal 
 
Yeah  do you like uphill or d- well you're down hill so do you eat at 
Yeah 
 
I eat at Dewick mostly 
you like dewick 
 
I like Dewick 
I'm sure you get Carm 
 
I like Dewick so much better 
Dewick is better  better it's that's known 
But Carm is just like  so much more convenient 
I think we should start calling Dewick just just Mcby  just throw people off 
Change it up 
 
I mean it wouldn't change the person is just what it is 
Yeah  that's funny 
 
Yeah 
people would be so confused 
 
I got people call south  um Harleston cause somebody else put money into it 
I know 
Um but most people still call it south 
Yeah 
Like I feel like Macphie's being left out 
Everyone knows it's south 
 
Yeah 
 
Yeah 
 
oor Mchee 
 
oor Macphie 
 
Yeah 
no this is it one person or is it two 
I think it's two people 
Yeah 
like Dewick isn't the first name 
um 
 
No 
It's Dewick 
I don't think Dewick's a first name 
they're both the last name 
 
No my name is Dewick that's that'd be weird yeah 
no 
Dewick Machee I don't know 
 
I don't know what it's d- do 
That's like there's so many Tisch buildings 
 
Yeah 
Like there's the library and then the gym 
All the Tisch family's the Tisch family's ridiculously wealthy 
Yeah 
Like they own the they own the New York Giants 
 
Okay 
o like  if they can own a sports team  they can buy buildings at all these colleges 
Yeah 
 
Like almost every major college like has a Tisch building of some kind 
I just don't get what the purpose of that is 
 
Like investing their money into schools 
Yeah 
 
Higher education 
Yeah 
I don't know  that's what their that's what they believe in 
that's Nice 
ome people believe in investing in  like more and more real estate to make more money they believe in investing in  peoples' futures 
mhm 
That's cool 
By building Nice gyms 
didn't think about it that way 
 
The gyms 
 
yeah 
 
Keep the  s- Tufts students healthy 
 
let's fight obesity  let's put a giant hill right here 
 
That'll help 
 
o after you work out you have to walk up hill again 
Might have killer calves 
oh yeah 
 
That's the whole goal 
 
ugh 
like if I had a set three goals for my entire time at Tufts  the top  three goals would all be to get killer calves 
 
I feel like  wa- I have to every time I'm our field is down hill 
 
Okay 
so like everyday  the walk from 
 
Craft  to Hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far 
Yeah 
And three days a week I have French right after practice 
ooo 
 
so either way I'm going like all the way to Olin 
 
it's far 
and it's just miserable 
It's so far 
Yeah 
especially now that it's cold  it's pretty bad 
 
but Being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class  like you're  at the same level as the classes like I have to walk uphill to every class 
Yeah 
 
That's true 
 
and have  enough of a break time in between classes where I have to go back to my dorm to like  do like do work and do things 
mhm 
Yeah 
And then go back to class so I'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum 
Yeah where are most of your classes 
 
um  probably like they're in the academic quad mostly 
Okay 
But um  it's nice I have one class in Granoff so 
uhuh 
I don't have to walk very far for that 
That's nice  yeah mine is I've one in Granoff too and then 
 
I have one in Eaton so that's Kinda 
Okay 
 
I don't know what that counts as 
 
think it's still the academic quad 
Yeah  and then Olin and then psych 
 
Yeah 
 
o 
 
Not bad 
Not bad 
 
it works out 
Yeah I feel like if I were coming from Hil  Oli- like  going to Olin and going to psych would be so easy 
Yeah 
But like Eaton in  Granoff doesn't really ap-  matter 
 
Yeah Granoff's really easy for me 
It would be the same from anywhere 
 
yeah 
cause it's like a one minute walk from Hodge 
Yeah  I have four classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
Really 
But then on I have no classes Wednesday  and I only have one class on Monday and Friday  so it's like a weird like I a-  pretty much always have a four day weekend 
 
that works 
Which is nice 
 
Yeah I set up my classes differently I have  two on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday 
 
Okay 
And then I have one recitation on Friday 
 
That's nice 
um so it works out 
that's really evenly broken up 
Yeah  and I thought that would be beneficial  it's not 
You don't like it 
it just means I have work due every day 
 
yeah  that's what  I like about having Wednesdays off 
mhm 
cause like I don't really have to do stuff Tuesday night 
 
Yeah 
 
But like I can if I wanna get ahead and then I don't have to do anything Thursday nights 
 
That works 
Like I would do it again I think  but I also end up wasting a lot of time  cause my classes like if I don't I don't have class till six M on Monday  
 
so I end up just like sleeping in too late 
Really 
 
But  you get you get you get 
Yeah I mean I have class at nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays I hate that 
 
Yeah 
And it's so early 
 
I have  yeah I have I have that too 
And it's weird cause like I had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school 
I have English 
 
mhm 
Like I thought that was early and I think this is early even though it's later 
Yeah like getting up at eight 
I think it's 
like I get up at eight for my nine ams 
Yeah 
 
I feel like next semster I'm gonna try and go for  everything after ten 
yeah for sure 
Especially cause now like at least  first semester I can't have any classes between  three  and  five six  three and six so like I have the that whole chunk of time likeI couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now I'm more flexible 
that makes sense 
 
Yeah cause of soccer sports yeah 
Yeah but I'm still trying to have Wednesdays off  it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week 
it breaks up the week yeah that would be  that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off 
Yeah it's like you don't like Fridays off are nice but having one class on Fridays isn't the end of the world 
no I have a rescitation that's not mandatory 
Yeah 
and like its 
what for what class is it 
for stats 
 
Okay 
Um  I only have to show up  if like when I pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance 
mhm 
 
Okay 
 
Um so that helps 
yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta- 
e- yes except for stats which has three 
Including rescitation 
Okay 
 
okay 
 
But yeah  it's nice 
 
Yeah 
One of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes 
 
Uhhuh 
And he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class I mean 
Yeah 
and Like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either 
mhm 
on Fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory 
oh my gosh  I'm worried for next semester cause I'm trying to take five classes 
 
ame though 
 
And then like  most of them like  if I take econ I'll have a rescitation 
Okay 
French two will have a rescitation 
Yeah 
 
I wanna take computer science 
 
I do too but I don't know when I want to take it 
I know 
Like I want to take next semester but I feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it 
I know 
I don't it want to be a super busy clas I want to be able to like learn well for that class  
Yeah 
I've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all 
well I don't know which is which 
I know I need to figure it out too my one friend was like 
Rate my professor 
Yeah 
work works really well 
 
that is a good one 
 
my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever 
Yeah 
 
That works 
o we'll see 
 
Yeah 
 
Yeah 
I don't know 
I I just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was 
 
Yeah that's how I feel 
But 
 
I took four pretty easy classes 
Yeah me too 
Or classes that don't have a lot of work 
Yeah 
so  ah 
Like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually 
It;s reading heavy 
it's reading heavy 
which takes a long time but isn't that hard 
Yeah and like I feel like  my notes I'm so particular about how I take my notes that it takes even longer like 
Do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read 
 
o  I like have tried everything  like  oh I used to go paragraph by paragraph which I know you're not supposed to do 
mhm 
 
but  so then like this past time for chapter eight I would read through 
 
All of eight point one  like eight one A B C or whatever  and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like I knew  like I didn't have to re read each paragraph 
I kinda knew what was going on 
Okay 
 
Um but that  took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four 
Really 
 
Like I sat in Tisch from  seven to eleven  
 
Damn 
 doing psych  [ ] 
 
that's that's tough 
And it's like it's such a  it's like not a waste a time but like  I could have been  I feel like there's got to be a better way to do it  
 
ee I don't take notes at all when I read cause I'll just get distracted by it like I'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading 
Yeah 
and I won't learn as much from it 
uh huh 
I like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book  
Yeah 
and I'll go back and do those after 
 
Just so I really master it 
Like the the quizzes or the 

Yeah like a  flash cards and quizzes I can go back and do those 
Yeah  maybe I'll try that for chapter ten 
 
Yeah 
Like I just feel like if I get through chapter nine I'll be fine  cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning 
yeah 
Yeah 
 
And then I'll just be able to like  I can just review extra for it 
Yeah 
for test on Thursday 
That works it's the balance that I just take like really  like  really affected notes in class 
Yeah 
or I'll write down more than I necessarily 
Yeah 
but just so I have it 
 
Yeah 
 
Yeah 
I feel like 
 
My class notes could be better  but it's also like I  I feel like I  don't pay as much attention  in class because I know I have the reading to fall back on 
Okay yeah 
But like that's not good like I need to be paying attention in class but we'll see 
I get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture I'm like  okay I I I g-  I not really getting right now just like go for further reading 
Yeah 
 
Um in the sometimes right the opposite world  like I'll read it after like a lecture  and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this do 
this doesn't make as much sense anymore 
mhm 
Yeah 
 
so but it is what it is I got 
Yeah 
It's really just studying for exams  and learning the material 
Yeah 
exactly  and like the  I feel like  this exam will be a little easier to study for 
well not that we've seen the exam questions 
Yeah 
from the first one we know how to do it 
Yes and like  it's not as much it's not as specific I feel like the material  
Yeah 
it's more theories and like vague stuff 
A little more vague 
 
whereas like  last time we had to know like all the different functions 
yeah 
and I was like  lots of flash cards with that one 
I spend so much time just making flashcards and then I found out they had like the flash cards built in 
I know 
And I was like really did I just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason 
 
That's  all my friends did the same thing and I just like  I ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before  like I took super diligent notes 
which made it easier 
mhm 
 
but  I'm not doing that this time like I need to start studying tomorrow 
 
You know I promised myself I'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time 
 
Uh I didn't cause I just finished chapter eight so 
Yeah  I finished chapter eight on Thursday 
 
I finished it 
Wednesday Thursday 
Yesterday  so that was Friday 
Yeah 
Yeah 
And chapter nine and ten are apparently really long 
 
There's like five and six parts each 
Yeah  and like the within the individual sections like  they all scroll 
Yeah 
for a really long time and I'm just like I can't do this 
 
so much 
Do you ever watch the videos 
 
Yeah  um  if it seems like a short chapter 
Yeah 

I feel like an actor now 
yeah 
 
This is like this room's like set up like I literally feel like I'm being like interviewed 
Yeah 
 
When will CNN recognize me 
This is a news cast 
 
If I like  had to um  I think like  I don't know I feel like in a d- very dream world I would be an actor 
 
I don't  I think like if I had  talent in that aspect I would be an actor  like 
 
I feel like my ultimate life goal would be in like a really like a well known movie franchise 
Yeah 
Like I don't know I feel like  a life goal for me would to  if I was an actor would be to be in the MCU or like tar Wars 
 
Like 
 
Like something like I could 
Like  job security 
Yeah like job security 

like there's gonna be  there's gonna be at least eight movies 
I know also like cultural impact toolike 
Yeah 
like literally everyone knows who like Carrie Fisher is 
Yeah 
like  I don't know it's they're like really recognizable people they're like very iconic but also 
mm 
I feel like the only problems like people  think like oh you're just  you're just like this character 
you're 
like Harry potter 
Yea 
Like Daniel Radcliffe  can't get another job 
 
And honestly like  I guess wait what's who's Hermione Granger 
Emma Watson 
Emma Watson has done a better job breaking out 
I know yeah 
 
But  I feel like Daniel Radcliffe just gave up 
mm 
and started doing weird movies 
Maybe that's why 
And Broadway 
 
Or maybe he just enjoys doing that better 
 
Yeah maybe he does enjoy doing weird movies 
I don't know I feel like Emma Watson's more main stream 
Yeah she is 
Although I feel like it's easier for like  female actors to like  get 
 
More roles I guess 
Maybe 
 
I don't know 
Maybe it's because all female roles are so similar to each other 
That's true  don't have to be that diverse 
Yeah 
 
What happened to  Ron's actor like 
 
Oh he was in a  the last time I saw him was in an Ed heeran music videoyeah 
really 
 
Was he like an Ed heeran clone 
Yeah 
What 

That that was literally the the premise I'll show you after this 
oh my god 
the premise was like he 
 
He's like a crazy Ed heeran fan 
What 
And he's like  trying to steal his identity or something something like that  I don't know 
But can he sing though? 
 
I don't 
 
It's very strange 
 
Oh my god 
 
Yeah 
 
mm 
 
I wo̲nder li̲ke what's gonna h̲appen to like  all the a̲ctors̲ like a̲fter they leave like major fra̲nchises c̲ause they still like  ∆I don't know∆ cause it's either like they m̲ake i̲t r̲eally̲ big? 

mhm 
or they don't at all  or like or they like th- they're like so we̲ 

 

But at least she's got  his somewhere now 
Yeah she's definitely made it  W of auto is very talented  had a one to five psych  very talented 
 
Whatever they're doing now is  I don't know it 
 
I've I wonder  how people feel like looking back like if if we could get like a really honest like interview 
 
mm 
like I wonder like Like well they act what do they actually think about like being a Disney star 
Yeah the 
Yeah  I think like  like Miley Cyrus has talked about toxic it is 
mm 
 
especially so she did it with such at such a young age and with her dad  was like super toxic for her  and then  I don't know  I feel like she did it  so well like she break out of the role so well 
mhm 
 
because she like  she had the phaser everyone was like what are you doing 
I think  I remember reading like online like  like some people are it's like discussing like oh like  discussing like Miley Cyrus is like crazy stage in like now heard like  so she's like normalize now 
Yeah 
I think they're talking really uhm like  like the crazy stage was definitely like a marketing ploy like a publicity stunt 
Uhuh 
 
because like  the whole point of it I think they said was like to like change her image from 
Yeah 
From like a child star to like  being  taken more seriously 
I think that so I definitely think there right 
Yeah 
 
The Disney conspiracies Hey 
I know 
 
elena Gomez and have to  but she wasn't as iconic as  Hannah Montana 
I guess here 
yeah 
 
I think that's it 
I feel like it wasn't was it it's a way early place like more recent 
 
Yeah it was more recent  still gotcha 
 
I like never watch Disney channel's a child so like  so like all the classic I Kotick ones like I don't really know them 

 
clip server it so like I know like who the characters are  for like I'm not that familiar with like 
 
Yeah 
The actual  show 
Yeah  it's like cuz it  that like they could like reference like they're Italian  heritage and like they're like  static heritage and then also like  I feel like that's so raven  did you watch that's so raven 
No I but I know of it 

 
o what what what the paper like say like about how races like depicted 
 
I don't know those I don't remember really very well it was like  it was just like 
 
Hello everyone understands like  like even though you didn't  have Disney Channel you still know the shows and stuff you still know the characters 
mhm 
 
um 
 
I don't know 
I think that's just like part of being a kid though because like  like all you talk like oh like did you see  like uhm did you see like the new episode like last night of like level are show 
Yeah 
I mean I feel like that's like  I feel like it's the same with like adult shows know except I feel like 
mm 
 
Like not 
Netflix 
Yeah now kids like they have Netflix so it's like  more accessible than if you like only had cable 
Yeah  and also  like  if you think about it shows like the office caroling a long time ago but now kids are watching 
Yeah like a 
I know 
 
o weird 
 
My brother was talking about like  like uhm  like how looks  like sometimes  like now in the morning on the weekends would you like to leave a get out of it he just literally watches entire seasons of the office it's 
 
It's  that's  a  that's a mood 
 
I miss high school 
 
I know when you like you didn't have to actually get out of bed 
Yeah  when you like  I guess because you didn't have a roommate 
That's 
 
o known good actually judges 
Yeah  I feel like if I stayed in bed all day  my roommate would definitely touch 
Genevieve wood we like are you sick like what's 
Yeah 
 
Requires you functioning human being  the whole time I've been hiding them 
 
 
I cannot like  I don't think I can physically like  watch TV that log for like 
 
mm 
four hours straight 
I certainly feel really like  rocky 
Here the 
Yeah 
 
Also a knuckle I like  even like  part way through it up the so like I kinda get ir to get bored 
 
Really yeah 
Yeah 
 
Does a show 
 
I can't do like  I can't really do sit carbs because most of time like 
oh 
 
like I hate crew G humor like 
I hate  laugh tracks 
Like I I feel like a currency humor so much I'm just like  I need to like  get up and like Walker out to so I could like  deal with this courage 
The second hand embarrassment 
I know 
 
It's like oh my god like how can you read the still 
 
I didn't  really  get bothered by laugh tracks until a solid 
 
Like means about it online about how annoying they were and then I could never  on notice 
mm 
Yeah like I always see them now it's like 
Yeah 
 
they're not that necessary 
Yeah 
 
I used to love the Big Bang theory and then I realize like how about it 
oh 
 
it's not  I think that if you think about the purpose of the show that is not even like  out great I guess 
Yeah 
 
and also like  they pointed out a lot of problematic is about the characters like 
Yeah 
 
Like why is penny so stupid and 
Yeah 
 
Yeah 
 
I just like  like I wonder like it what  the heldon's actor feels about the role 
 
Yeah 
 
because it's like  it's a very like  I don't is like the most well known character out of all of them 
Yeah 
But like  he's not exactly like 
 
I could 
In known like  known like for 
Yeah 
For being a good character 
Yeah 
 
He's done like  the act I really like the actor he's only other stuff  like he was in the Muppets movie 
all 
what 
 
Of  and then he's also playing like 
 
Uhm  there's a show that's coming uhm not there's that movie that's coming out  it's about 
 
Transmission standard kid 
 
mm 
and he plays a father 
o all 
Yeah 
 
This thing 
Yeah 
 
I don't know I feel to   although to be honest  if you're like on a TV show that makes a lot of money I  I would understand why people would not want it to like  want to leave it 
 
Yeah  yeah 
 
Because you have to ride the train as long as it makes money 
 
Ride the train 

 
True  like 
 
But then you also have to like  stop  before you go down hill 
That's true  I feel like you have to leave  like  at a good point  like I heard awesome 
 
Like the lead character from the walking dead hit the actors leaving the show 
 
Which one 

oh the lead 
Here the lead character 
Oh uhm  the one with the 
 
The beard yet yeah that guy 
Fair yeah 
 
Of 
 
Well he  says he gonna get killed off so I was going to work 
I don't know uhm  I don't know because it's like  I feel like  I mean like I I've heard the walking dead has gone really downhill 
Yeah 
Uhm  for like I feel like  because like every time like the actors like leave the show that they like kill the off 
Yeah 
 
I think that I think I've only seen  one episode like one actual season of the walking dead season five 
mm 
but like the only character like I really liked  when I watch it was uhm tephen young's character 
Oh  and  rest in peace 
Yeah rest in peace 

 
I  I just know that like 
 
Like  they've gotten too crazy 
mhm 
 
I think it's just like 
And the premise 
 
I mean I guess there's not a lot you can do in the long run 
 
The thing is like  a zombie like people living in the zombie apocalypse  would not have survived for as long as a season 
 
Like I repressed it there's still that many people in like the issue human  her hold 
yeah 
Yeah we have like a baby to or something 
I know they had a Beatles like  that baby's gonna like die 
Yeah  have you seen the quiet please 
 
No but I like  know that the plot and  roughly 
The harmacia 
Yeah 
 
They have like a baby like 
What the hell 
Tearing that  link how 
 
Like honestly though like  because like it's like the mother die s like how you're going to feed the baby that 
 
Oh true I don't think about that 
 
And also like babies are loud like how did those monsters like not kill a  all the 
that's the thing 
 
That  that is the 
 
As a problem in the movie 
 
Is like how do you keep the baby during this 
I e 
like a real all you did like when that when I felt when I heard they had like a baby carriages like  how did this all these like not kill the baby like already 
Yeah 
because like  yes so loud you have to like 
 
 
Carry it everywhere 
I know  I know I feel like I'm like  I feel like to be like  close up of apocalyptic plots are like the most interesting because like I've always like 
mm 
 
all like how like societies gonna fall apart or like how people are gonna like recover 
that's so dark 
 
I know but I'm I feel like they usually make for like really good promises in like 
Like simulations kind of 
But yeah like movies are like video games 
 
mhm 
but like I feel like uhm 
 
Doesn't like Kerio like that  I'm not  for me I don't really like reading  like reading about it 
Oh 
Like like it us in a book for 
 
Yeah 
But like I like group  and I kind of look like see in person &=la ughs just because like to see how it's all his realized 
Of like because there's a Lotta world building 
Yeah  there is 
When it comes so that  there's some good books that really  did it well  that I couldn't put down 
   
  
 
But  yeah I tried reading have you heard of annihilation 
 
Oh yeah I've heard of of it 
Yes like a book that they turned into a movie 
mhm 
 
movie looks pretty good but I try to read the book and I was like I can't get pass 
What is it what is it about 
 
Uhm  basically like  the world is like  it's like one of the I think it's one of those things where it's like  all the city is a safe place 
mhm 
but like once you leave the city it's like there's a lot of stuff going on 
mhm 
but basically it's like 
 
It's almost like  like weeds like these plants and stuff like 
 
All the organisms are like  like altered and like weird  and like distorted 
What 

Outside in the world so like  they sent  this woman like  her husband gets sent out 
mhm 
to like  research it and explore it but he like 
 
He like comes back like  really different or something  and so  they think like  it's not  him it's actually like a copy of him that the outside world made 
oh 
 
uit like  they sent a bunch of like  other researchers out or something 
 
 
And the yeah  are you ever gonna watch it the end of the movie is really trippy 
 
I heard something about a bear 
 
Oh  a bear 

I don't know  I don't I don't remeber what animal it was  Like I remeber being a lot of people are like  kind of like  like discussing oh like  what is like the most trippy trippy thing you've seen in a movie or like what's  and people were like talking about like Annihilation and they were like there's like some bear some animal 
Oh really 
I don't know 
I want to wash it 
 
Yeah 
 
Just for the pen her  that's like the bear in the 
 
 
The one that Leonardo  di Caprio was 
 
All the revenue 
Yeah 
 
I still don't know that's about like I heard he was like 
F 
 
Really extreme stuff to get into the role 
 
I think he  I think he only had 
 
I think I don't know if  this is  happen in the movie I think he  l ike kill the bear and to stay warm he crawled inside is 
What the  fuck 
 
What the very get like cold both because it's dead 
 
What  it's still furry 
 
I guess 
 
How do you call it's  
 
I had uhm artistic event I guess it to slit it open and  get inside 
 
I guess 
 
uch as gross 
 
Who comes up for these parts 
Yeah or maybe it maybe I Just imagined 
Like 
 
Wait  I don't know honestly who because of these gotta plots like  like man gets trapped in wilderness  crawls into bear to stay warm  you watch that for two I hope 
 
Now I'm not we now I'm like questioning is that actually happens 
I 
 
Know that it definitely it that movie definitely happened 
 
I also heard like that was like some of the critique the critique about gravity  like it was just like two straight hours of like 
Oh well 
 
Whatever hurt the actress's name  however the actress was just like  like floating around in like  not really talking or something 
 
Yeah  oh that was some  also it's like all CG I feel like people like 
Yeah 
Kind of miss 
 
Of 
 
Also  what was that movie oh Dunkirk 
 
Is  that their  World War one one 
There is 
 
He yeah what we're what We're we're too 
What's Your styles one 
 
Yeah Harry styles 
 
Wait was it World War one or World War two 
I think it was World War one right 
One  yeah 
Yeah 
 

yeah  I don't know I liked it but there was n̲o talking  at all 
what really, 
yeah 
 
it was like  a w̲ar film? 
mhm, 
solidly a war film  like 
s- but there was like n̲ 
yeah like there was like  it was all 
 
like there was no d̲i̲alogue, y̲ 
so o- but was like the ↓dialogue implied like  like I don't know if like a general said like oh like here's our orders to like  go attack thi̲s area like  was that impl 
oh oh 
like  I guess t 
 
move the plot, 
mhm 
or like h- w-  was essential to the plot=it was like very like  realistic̲ 
mhm 
it would just be like oh like  very bare minimum  what needs to be said 
oh okay 
yeah 

 
Interesting 
Yeah really liked it  oh  really Harry styles 
 
He like upgraded 
Yeah he really  all he had to do was get a hair cut 
 
  
 
I know I think like  whatever watch movies I focus more it like 
 
Like I don't know what I see 
Yeah 
But like I always miss like intentional  like stylistic things 
Oh like  I mean  that's like any art  form  I see I feel like you need 
mhm 
 
he needs to be accessible to someone who doesn't have a degree and a 
Yeah 
 
I know because I feel like I've I like fixate more like  the characters  then like 
 
mm 
everything else in the movie 
Yeah 
 
Yeah  it's like 
 
It's like do you should you watch movies for the plot or the character development 
Like borrow like even like I know I can still like insure movie people if you people say it's bad 
 
Oh really 
Yeah cause like I don't know  like I enjoy it like despite the fact that it's bad because like  I don't know I found it like fun  like our  um  I think like last year  like during  I don't know maybe during thanksgiving break  like me and a few friends 
mhm 
from high school we watch the room 
 
oh the room 
in 

Yeah and we were like 
 
Oh 
We were like so confused but like  I don't know I kinda liked it cause it was so bad 
 
Wait the original the  not the disaster artist right? 

 
Yeah the original 
Oh my god 
 
I was like so confused I was like wait  what's going on like why like what is it what like what  where where is this story going 
I feel it that's why is a cult classic because it's so bad 
Nine 
I know 
 
Like some video on YouTube described it like it's like if an alien walk like if you show to alien  and explained in el did alien like  what movies are  but like the alien tried to be cool Knowing a lot of movie act  without like actually understanding like how  the movie like  it's like  why movie can be  like how a successful movie you operates it just like you ex lately go  a movieneeds fought like characters it needs  some plot  it needs like 
And it's like this This like drama that happens here 
A setting 
yeah 
 
it's like  I don't know  I like don't understand like  that will be at all 
 
It's like  I'm 
 
utting in  putting something into Google translate 
mhm 
taking the translated part and then putting it on the other side again so to translated again back into the original this is like not 
oh my god 
 
Yeah like whatever it whatever this is is like not  like I don't even know 
 
But  I heard like 
 
I heard like the guy who directed it  was like this  he had like a weir d backstory 
Yes  No like 
Cuz like a model 
Him  I don't know  it's like Tommy was those like 
Yeah the 
Like nobody knows like what we're he's from  like 
Yeah 
is that it's is just like showed up one day in the 
 
He had funny in a because uhm V 
He had money he had a weird accent that 

Yeah 
No one really knows where it came from 
I know like  thank 
 
It's like low key shady as hell 
Yeah  but  you know as an actor you probably do need  he 
This is true 
 
I one  I feel like those actors  the rest of the actors are probably like I can't believe  I've like 
That's 
participated for the I believe I I can't believe I participated in this 
 
Record R Mike 
 
But they got it do it right like state 
 
I don't I mean I feel like 
Like the act is seriously 
The other actors weren't even like that but though 
 
Yeah because they were the people that  can make it other roles 
Hello  it's like  like they're not good actors 
Yeah 
And the fact that they were in the room  only made it  made like  later on worse I guess 
 
Have you seen the disaster artist 
No  but it's like 
A good 
 
It's so slow to explain the backstory right 
Yeah  it's like based on like 
 
The guy who is this friends  who like  coat did stuff with him  uhm  it's like based on his biography 
oh 
 
Yeah 
 
o I guess like 
 
If you I read about it 
 
Thanks I guess there's like some  I mean obviously it like the Fred fall be like hit a bunch of stuff 
Yeah of 
 
For just like we don't like how the entire truth 
Yeah 
 
till doesn't make sense even if we have to  check 
 
 
That's true  to be fair  like a lot of directors make like interesting choices 
Yeah  yeah 
 
Like Michael ray explosions 
 
That's just throwing money at the CG I had he 
 
Every fair though  like  the explosions to get a lot of  at tention 
Yes say that because I know you like movies with lots of explosions 
 I would like it  easily or it you could like easily grab my attention  I know I I think I just like movies are like not realistic 
 
Oh 
Like I just I like things that are not like  set too much in the real world 
mm 
like I like I don't know I like MCU because it's like  it's like in the real world but it's like not 

 
What do you like 

 
Like I I don't know I like I like things like MCU cause 
Which 
 
Like the mar 

What's MCU 
The Marvel cin the Marvel movies 

Oh oh yeah 
Because like  they're like set you you know they're set in the real world but like  obviously there's a lot of like fantasy sci fi elements to it 
mm 
so I guess like um that's why I like it 
 
mm 
um 
 
I know also I guess  I just like  things about 
 
That are not like  common experiences 
Oh  yeah  like 
 
Like why would I watch movie that an average person get 
Yeah  I know like  to be on is like I can never really  get like  to be high and uhm  like movies like 
 
Uhm like about like  because like at  like everyday people 
 
mhm 
I know like I don't I don't really like high school movies because it's kind of like  this is it's like it's not realistic  but it's it's but like it's supposed to be realistic so it's like  I don't know like  how to feel 
The  I think a good enjoy enjoy like mean girls 
mhm 
 
because what they do is like the take  kind of real things and they just  exaggerated out of proportion 
I know 
 
It's like  more rial I don't 
 
But I guess like  those movies probably make more sense  like are more like realistic 
 
If you like went to high school and like the early two thousand through the nineties 
 
Yeah 
 
Because the culture is like definitely change like in like the way bullying is for trade it's not like uhm we're gonna I'll 
I'll  I'll 
He has not like we're going to like I don't know still your lunch money anymore it's like 
Yeah the 
 
sych over gonna like say things about you and like  keep posting like things about you 
AC into all the  boys I've  loved the forcibly 
What I heard is a really good 
 
Wait you haven't seen it 
No 
You should definitely watch it  like  first well Asian lead 
 
Great  and also like  yeah I mean they portray high school kind of  weird  but it's like  enjoyable because it's not real 
 
 
Yeah 
I think  the  main issues yes because the actors are so old  they're not actual teenagers so they like 
The area 
 
o like when you see a like  a high school movie it's always like  but doctors are you like what twenty or something 
I'm like no high school  junior senior looked This  attracted 
You 
I know exactly 
Not at my school 
 
Like it  my freshman look like literal children 
Yes  the fresher look like children and the seniors look like 
 
Like  men 
 
Yeah like  it does  and I guess it's like really jarring so like  not that helpful 

 
When you know  one was like 
 
Like there's nothing we can do like we should just like  sit back and wait for like new technology to like be invented  and the other one was like   um  there's nothing we can really do but we might as well try 
mhm 
 
Conflicting arguments or did you fall 
 
I  can't give an opinion it's like a writing about the arguments  like just I have to write about which argument is presented better 
Uhm 
 

it the one that  we might as well try 
 
That's optimistic 
I might be a little biased 
yeah probably 
but 
 
But  yeah someone else in the class chose the same one  and they chose the other article so 

Uhm that is true that's true 
But before I'm going to the French house  to get extra credit by going to their party first 
 
they've actually is it like a real party 

I don't think so 
or is it a French party 
I'm guessing since my teacher told me go to the French house for a soiree 
 
I mean you could be surprised 
Thank 
I could be surprised 

 
The French go wild 
 
Um  yeah and then we're doing that  but I mean we'll probably do some I don't know  I need to find a costume 
 
mm 
because my co- costume's required for  the for  my skiing thing on Friday 
That's required just goes yourself good uhm goes your brother 
 
you're so creative 
 
You were being uncreative today on the walk over 
What do you mean I was being uncreative 

I'm gonna buy random clothes I am that guy from that movie 
Yeah that's funny 
you know 
 
no it's not nobody's gonna get it 
 
I'll g- I'll think it's funny 
you should 
 
There is some in my school and from high school  she did like  you kno w those paintings of the pop art  type of thing  I get very and your dr awings there's like  also a photo later but she painted on her fa ce 
Okay 
 
And is actually very very cool impressive 
That's cool 
 
see I don't wanna do anything that requires effort 
 
oh What's your problem 
I just wanna buy clothes that match a costume 
oh 
usually where the unicorn onesie 
 
oh 
 
Yeah I wonder who yeah  that's actually a good idea I'll do that 
You're welcome  there is an added him to go 
o that's kind of a weird first impression to people that I don't know  but 
 
It's a costume you can't go wrong a Halloween 
True 
 
like you really can't 
 
what are you gonna dress as 
I don't know  Friday  came and fat is not have any open party this week end 
 
why can't you still go 
 
No because it's like he's out of  he's a pledge so you'd have like  control over it  so I'll be going to like I am going to my first tough party 
 
It is exciting 
Yeah I think on Friday afterwards we're gonna to go to the  data delta chi one probably 
 
be an adult   
 
I saw two that I like saw on Facebook 
it's just 
It's the like  I think it's like X O or something like that  it's like the howl at the moon or something like that I don't know 
Okay well maybe yeah 
It's one of those 
There's another one on aturday I know  but I thinkall I'm gunna do like cause I can't go with Cameron caue he has frat stuff most of the weekend 
oh 
 
o are you gonna be at Tufts all weekend 
 
Except for Friday yeah 
 
wait what did you just I thought you just said that your 

cause I have dinner 
 
oh 
mmm 
 
That's like a late dinner  but I think grace Meghan Frankie Michelle and I were all gunna do a group costume 
 
and  what we came up with yesterday was well my great idea was over the rainbow like we each be color of the rainbow cause there's like five of us 
its very five year old but 
 
It's easy and simple and you probably already have it in your closet 
 
They didn't like that idea they allwant to go 
Yeah I wonder why 
 

they wanna go thrift shopping, 
 
and 
yeah that's the most yeah go to Goodwill, 
 
no ap̲arently there's one in Davis 
 
what? 

there's apparently one in Davis 
Yes Goodwill 
 
oh is that actually a good will store? 
 
oh maybe it's not I thought it was, 
I thought it was just like another thrift store, 
there's l 
 
really? 
 
oh 
yeah, 
 

I didnt even know I haven't seen any of them 
There's like one that's like  there's one good one  I forget what they're called  one that's cool but it's like  actually expensive 
 
The point like not the winter stress 
so you don't wanna g- 
o it's not it's kind of defeats the purpose  I mean it's not like expensive expensive but it's  more expensive 
 
Okay 
And then there's one that's okay 
 
A good cheap but Frank you really wanna do Hippias 
 
His friend he wants to buy a pair of bell bottom jeans  I think this will b e good reason to do it  I don't I give off a hippie vibe  so 
 
eh 
 
Yeah exactly I don't 
 
so we'll see what'll happen 
 
you could do it 
 
Another good idea was it all goes animals because mac and really wanted to be   uhm a lobster with her boyfriend he's going home for the weekend 
 
Okay wait okay it takes me a second to think of 
He 
Megan's the tall blonde 
The n- 
I know I just need to like connect names to faces  but I got it now 
Okay  she uhm he went home for the weekend so that uhm it's all the animals that is a good dog out and making your lobster  and some of the uhm yea h I have a cat out and they're like wait may like I can't be a lopsided I'm here talking like normal animals 
 
No th- lobster's cool 
 
Yeah then my yard shot out the window 

 _

What inspired him to do that was he traveled the continent of outh America and like saw all the  poor Indigenous people  um  and he became very likes s-  peace and justice-y and socialism and stuff like that  and that's what's inspiring me I'm gonna write my twenty five page paper for my war class about Cuba _

 _

The third  that's ridi- _

I know _

what's the longest you've written _

 _

 _

Okay that's pretty solid I guess it's not that much you just have to do like over time  but yeah you should watch these movies with me _

 _

Actually like okay everyone wants to  the people I've told all want to watch Chinatown with me cause that's like some really famous movie _

                                                                                                     I don't know what that is _

 _

um  but then there's also like the dark knight it's like a modern one _

 _

Really _

Okay literally in class today  like cause I just want to the class the first time this morning  and like my brother and his friend are literally just like on their phones in the back full time and I'm like taking notes  like right nice and brother's like laughing at me  and um  but so he would literally like show us like  a single frame  of a movie and he would be like  look at how like  you know there's like the spot of light that was like position during the credit sequence like it changed and like  it wouldn't naturally be reflected but it's reflected anyway or something  or like so what are your guys thoughts on that what do you think  and I'm like _

 _

I have no fucking idea _

 _

And like _

and your brother's like um lacrosse _

He wasn't even no he's smart guy  he's but he's is in on the you know it's a film class or whatever _

                                                                                  In that class not paying attention _

Yeah  um  but like all these people are raising _

                               Is it an art credit _

I don't think so _

mm _

I wish it was  all these people are like raising their hands and like oh it's like  the difference between like this spectral reality and I'm like how did you get any of that like  I don't know but it's I've always wanted to take a film class so _

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         mm _

That is cool _

           I still might drop it cause it's so awk- wait did I tell you how awkward and how much social anxiety I had when I was like trying to figure this out cause I like  I literally emailed him  like the professor and I was like Hey like I just added this class what do I need to do to catch up and also I may drop it like really soon  because I'm not sure about like my other commitments yet _

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             mm _

 _

and so  I like made u all the stuff whatever I came to the class and I like introduced myself to him after class which I was  proud of myself for doing causeI never do stuff like that _

                                                                                                                                                          Yeah _

Yeah _

   I'm like so antisocial I was just gonna leave it but like I should just do this  but h- I like now it's even more awkward if I drop it because he like totally knows who am _

                                                                                                                                                                       Yeah _

why would you drop it _

         It's my fifth class and like _

 _

Oh because it's a fifth class _

          Depending on my other commitments or whatever and how  cause  literally the only reason I'm taking it's like for interest it's not like fulfilling anything for me  I'm pretty sure it's not an art credit  so _

 _

oh what else are you taking _

 _

all my classes are  this is what  wait did I tell you about my whole crisis that like maybe I'm  stupid _

 _

no _

 _

Of like all the classes I take or what everyone else considers like easy classes _

                                                                      No but you're in one that linguistics that you're like this is fairly hard _

 _

Yeah but like I feel like in general like people consider all the class that I take is like bullshit classes  because they're like humanities or whatever _

                                                                                                                                                            That means nothing _

 _

Anyway um _

      Most engineers might be able to take a humanities class and like  most engineers say that a humanities class is actually really hard _

 _

Okay _

Like they're looking for the easy one _

 _

Yeah I mean I don't know  _

        Quote end quote _

I feel like some people were in the classroom other like oh this is so whatever but anyway _

 _

Yeah I'm in like creative writing  a philosophy class called nothingness which is like super out there _

                                                                 Right right _

Yeah _

 _

Actually me and Darren had so much fun _

                  that dinner was fun yeah _

                                     Wait we actually had so much fun in that class after  we were literally like um he like did all these drawings in my no- cause they were having like technical difficulties with playing like the m- videos and stuff so we were just like chilling  and so he was like drawing all these weird drawing in my notebook and we were like  writing like weird poetry in our notebooks and like writing notes and stuff it's actually really fun _

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              that's fun _

um  but yeah  what was I saying okay yeah nothingness creative writing _

 _

Now I'm in this film class stats and this linguistics _

 _

they sound that's a lot _

 _

I just like suddenly got really insecure about like _

 _

in yeah _

Because you know last year I was like oh like you know getting to college I was like oh no it's gonna be like hard to do well and I was like oh I'm actually doing well  but now I'm re like oh okay I'm doing well but it's in these like classes that people considerable bullshit _

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            mm _

and like when I'm actually taking a class like romance linguistics I'm like I have no idea what's goin gon _

                                                                                                       cause they're hard _

 _

Yeah _

 _

But I've realized I need to just like study for that class I can't just do the readings I have to like go back and know it _

 _

That's annoying _

   Cause you live through it like you have to know like the tongue like position when you say like  ul or whatever and like _

 _

Yeah they but I remember we had a a person come in to CB last year and try teaching that stuff and I was like what _

                   o many like technical _

 _

In CB? _

Cognitive brain science yeah _

                   uhuh _

 _

tats is actually  seemingly  okay it just is fine _

 _

Everyone said it was gonna be really easy but then someone I talked to said like  it's not as easy as everyone says like they said towards the end it gets hard _

                                                                                                                                                              Yeah it'll probably get harder cause stats does get harder but right now it's like  been fine _

 _

 _

He'd have to go to get it for me because I can like walk all the way down  yeah  in the end like what it was like the  didn't figure out what it w as either I'm _

 _

They thought it was a  was it _

 _

Like the health services doctor thought that it was like  tendonitis or something _

oh _

  like  along  the right side of my foot  um   but then when I started doing um  what's it called _

 _

not _

I think yeah it's definitely got a better look over like the past few months I think like at the beginning of school like  I can like public  if I stood on it for like normal stance for too long to like like puts like the too much pressure like that it was like stepping like _

 _

Not hurting but just like uncomfortable  and so that's when it at but chif rin pressurelike I think like now it's like  almost normalize to like the point were like I think it  if I had like tanford along how club I'm in the choirs like sometimes were like skinny too long like  that's when the guilt feel like little bit discomfort but  yeah I think everything's like better _

mhm _

                                                                                                                 yeah h _

                                                                                Right  yeah _

 _

F _

Yeah I mean I kind of though okay because the timing of the surgery  was  meant that like  I had the thanksgiving days off _

Yeah _

  and then and weekend _

 _

um _

and then I took Monday off and then like  I want to I came for clas ses on Tuesday  uhm but I moved back to campus on Wednesday because I was s taying  at a friend's apartment  like I my parents came _

                                                                                                                                                                                                         mm _

 _

mm _

 to like help  with everything _

 _

But like  F if I had to have the surgery like a different time I would  like I would have to miss when will cost  spend  harder _

like if it's good because _

  Yeah _

 _

Like  the surgery that I got out means  I can still kind of like  walk just  it takes longer _

Yeah _

   But  like  there was an option for different surgery  wher e they would of  reattached the piece of cartilage that fell off _

oo _

um _

 _

and like  and they were like the place my like I'm instead of just typ ing it up _

 _

And so that would have been like a more major surgery  like I woul d've been in more pain  so  in the in  like that case I would miss like so much more school I would like been bedridden probably _

yeah _

And like  so close to finals especially that we have just and such a nightmare _

                                                                             And like not being yeah _

What  is your focus _

 _

o  the way folks is like structured as uhm  it's  national coast at the same time as focused as _

 _

Yeah I think so _

  It's go, focus and two start together and then fit  cafe and squad   start afterwards  like I- I think a day or two afterwards _

Oh no I think it was the other way around _

Oh was it _

   'Cause  I remember for us go started on the twenty sixth  and  so three of them started on the twenty sixth and three started on the twenty fourth _

                                                                                                                                                Oh right 'cause it's _

um _

 G-go and fit  go-go and fit started on the same time cafe started earlier _

                                                                         Yeah cafe starts with two and focus and then go starts with fit  a nd squad _

 _

Okay yeah _

Okay yeah _

 _

I know the the cafe ago  yeah  so I'm it's ca lled _

 _

I think the change like a little bit now but like how  it was like the pass is that on  it's like you know like when you I sentenced with different her oes and stuff like that have a description so if you center for focusing except into focus  um  and then there's gonna be like a sec ond him at the comes out and like it really just be I think  just informati on about yourself and then there's also uhm  a bunch different except categories of service we want to do because folks his surroundings community service _

mhm _

 _

on to this like arts advocacy children's advocacy like environmental homel essness  uhm to be to Cuba to see uhm _

 _

Does _

 _

It is it a bunch of other stuff like that too on each year the psych wards I can you want added on to  and then once you like  you choose like I think  five your top five or something _

and then _

   mhm _

      um _

 _

I'm a member this for l ike when I was first you like I have like looked into this again  um  and then  you like she's like you rank  the ones that you want  and then you just a kind of wish that _

 _

Okay _

   And then like later on like towards the end the summer like we're like I think mid July or something  um  the court date and like sent you a gain like an email  that has like your placement  uhm  and then l ike it also has a courses in a group  and then the leaders to _

mm _

 _

It's like the way the fifties instruction in the past is that uhm  everyone sits in churches _

 _

ometimes like people it literally sleeping churches but then other times is like  buildings that are like  calc attached to a church that like _

                                                                                                                                                      Okay _

                                                                                                                                                         The like sleeping like some of the concerns  on _

 _

Yeah  and then  uhm for it's like the difference of categories is like t here's not just one group from missus is like comes this one who misses two home s history _

mhm _

 _

Yeah  and then  uhm for it's like the difference of categories is like t here's not just one group from missus is like comes this one who misses two home s history  um but they all turn to tell like are in the same church _

 _

Yeah what else can I say  I  just like  it's really fun because l ike than like  what  we kinda stop using them in language  I don't know if like  you ever use like  go brother's something _

 _

Uhm _

 _

not really _

         I don't think thirty because like _

 _

Yeah I think it's more of a good thing  for I think two  I think for fit and focus because like when you're in like a small group but if you only like if you the people than like  in the past thank you kindly  what's it like you were like a family and then he be like oh this is like my fo brother   thank my first Esther and stuff like that _

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               uhuh _

Oh yeah we we used to like  joke about like might conceive was my advise always like joke about her being a go mom but like _

 _

she like really hated that because _

Yeah yeah _

 _

he's like  realy young from software like I'm  kind of old for the or so she's only  like her birthday was during go _

mm _

 um  and she trying nineteen and like  so you're basically a month older than me so she was lik e it's so weird for you to call me ago on like that _

ounds old but like I'm really not _

                                 Yeah   we like it used to be like than past I know  B ears like it was like an issue last year _

 _

Like when I was like a freshman uhm _

 _

Like the leaders gave us the option is iconic opt  you're like often route  it was like the like the like all it is what we did in the past like we he 's a family language _

mhm _

like if you think think think  you're comfortable w ith it like we can totally is if not like if there's like one person was uncomfo rtable with it like  the neck we won't use it off like  Texas anonymous and everything  thank every decided that  we were fine with it um   but then this really becomes the complete like it did make an option which i s like no other feelings at all  and it's really just because like  tha t's really the exclusionary to like other freshman because like when you coming in like you're in the call the things about your fo family to fan and stuff like that _

 _

mhm _

and then um there's some people who like _

 _

Didn't wanted you prefer than this other people like training like couldn't affo rd to do prio _

mhm _

 _

and like make some feel cadet like  out of it  like I think that the first few weeks and like I know that a lot of people told me t hat  and it's also like  really don't know like some people family situ ation so like _

 _

mhm _

effectively don't have like  I said like  the parent or guardian or something so _

                                                                                         Yeah sure _

                                                                                                  Is that  where those things  yeah  so then I'm  also with folks it's like _

 _

With like _

 _

It's check kindly forms like upon and stuff like that and then _

 _

Most of the days like you doing like  one or two like service sites  o n and the support staff is really like  there like help like  everyone a little psych the courts with definitely need but then also like to like  drive  them to difference as because now everything's in like  Medford or omerville a Boston like some of it's like  I was like an hour away _

mhm _

so there's like sports stuff is like intro to psych driving in t he picking up sites and then like  one of the places  uhm but like eve ry group also has an off day  and on the off to like they can do like whate ver they want and like they have to get like  amount of money like they can spend to like the one he's a good go to a restaurant like went to Boston link   could convince _

 _

  _

 _

   Like so in touch with your _

 _

Okay yeah _

        Yeah _

 _

 _

mhm _

 _

yeah _

 _

But I think  it's just like yeah _

 _

It's interesting for like some leaders I know who like go and like  expect to like  I have like a really like tight knit group and stuff like it hasn' t always like like out like that just because like _

                                                                                                                                                                                                               Yeah _

 _

Have to consider when I'm like  when I hire the staff and the like assigning a good appears  because and it's like after like  some like I know t hat a lot of leaders but then I also like don't know some of them _

 _

thank  I'm like never so like  I'm like matter to people who like a sailing are compatible or like _

                                                                                                          Yeah _

 _

That which the because like a weird like dynamic _

Yeah _

    For their group _

Because I  like when  on the first day of go and I was like really aw kward and  everybody was like doing introductions and stuff _

 _

Uhm  like _

 _

The advisors I kept on saying like oh yeah like  I really like make someone friends during go and like it's quite often like you like  the first person like the meet and like who's in your go group and like end up being best friend s with them or whatever it and like your friends for  all four years wha tever and _

 _

Like I kind of just to me it sounded like  I am a this is the _

 _

Um it's like  racquetball  except like the ball is smaller  it's like tennis inside like inside a room _

 _

What made you get into the red uhm squash _

um  My parents just signed me up for it when I was a kid  you know like  it's really fun  I think it's a lot more from than like _

I sure you the run a lot as well _

 _

I mean squash is like a lot of  short movements it's like _

 _

You hit like the room isn't that big so you can run from corner to corner _

 _

Yeah _

 _

How do you  like what's like  I- I'm not familiar with like the how it works like the- the matches and like the scoring or like points _

it It's- it's like ping pong score right  it's goes to eleven win by two um imagine it's like tennis except like you hit it against the wall _

Wait wait how do you get like  score a point against your opponent cause you're both in the same room right _


If it bounces twice _

o bounces twice okay _


Yeah so like  imagine  you're like playing tennis except like  both sides of the cout are like mirrored on one side _

Mmmmm _

o like you hit the ball against the wall like imagine that's like going across the court  and then it bounces off and then your opponent has to hit it back onto the wall _

When you hit it though you have to like step  aside for your opponent to c-  _


Well yeah there's like enough room you do you don't want to hit it to yourself otherwise you'll get like  point off _

Aye _

 _

Do you- that means you can also- can you guys like add spins to your shots or like _

Yeah _

Okay _

 _

tranger in this names psych lab a real live in the same dorm _

feel like _

I know _

We may must be in all the same classes _

This solution what way whether class soon _

We went to the same _

um I take  linguistics  um Chinese three  sta _

 _

I don't wanna whenever people ask me the classes i take I always forget at least one _

No I haven't suite on the why _

oh God  have to like go to my sche- oh comp sci comp eleven   a _

Comp sci _

 _

oh what's the last one _

 _

This always  happens _

Or _

 _

U _

 _

Music theory of music _

Music theory linguists mute _

Yeah _

 _

ir can John your class _

 _

In which class music theory _


 _

Me neither linguistics or music theory _

linguistics I don't know anybody cause I don't go to class _

 _

I mean it's it's like _

 _

I say that stat like the stuff that we learn is like pretty like esoteric and like not useful but like linguistics is like on a whole nother level of useless _

 _

  _

 _

It's _

and Like  it's  if you ever wanted to know what like the  the bilabial valer like  tract of your like tongue is then like take linguistics otherwise do not _

 _

What- what is that _


it's like it's in _

 _

wait it's j̲ust the intro _

 _

yeah _

okay o̲ _

 _

but like it's ∇w̲ay _

 _

mm _

than I was expecting, _

 _

∆which if you like maybe if you went∆ to like a h̲igher like  level linguistics it'd be m- it'd be more interesting? _

I m̲ _

probably? _

 _

I don't kno̲ _

 _

cause I ↑feel like more- m- _

you have to build on those, _

 _

∆cause I feel like∆ most intro classes are ⁎like m _

yeah exactly that's why it's like really specific, _

so it's like kind of boring _

s- oh _

I-  I'd like it's if it was general I think I would enjoy it mo̲re actually, _

oh _

°no,° _

 _

nevermind then _

Yeah _

 _

I mean it's required for CB majors _

Yeah  I my friends also CV  house comp sci eleven junior _

 _

uh did I mention that I hate my life I hate my classes um  it's like  it's it's not bad  honestly I I'm doing pretty well so _

 _

it's just all the homeworks take forever _

 _

Yeah I heard that too _

Yeah _

 _

Television _

As long as I make through  comp fifteen if I can't make it through then I have to like totally change everything _

Oh my god _

I don't know I don't  cause comp fifteen I'm like worried cause after that you ta- you take that  you take like one hundred level course in comp sci and then like  you don't have to take anymore for CB _

 _

yeah _

 _

Comp sci  they were just like the  the hard  like super hard comp sci class _

Comp forty _

Company as _

 Yeah _

You don't _

and comp fifteen's supposed to be pretty hard so _

Them  are you to do with the come forty two or no no _

Yeah _

 _

That's good _

Yeah _

It's good _

And if I don't if I decide to like  if I can't handle comp fifteen I could just minor and you don't need to take come fifteen _

We should _

 _

huh _

 _

A what moment you wanna be a CV major _

 _

um I mean I thought about psychology  but then like I kind of wanted to like diversify you know _

 _

so _

 _

Yeah basically and comp sci's like pretty interesting  I like it _

 _

Yes for interesting _

 _

And I'm thinking about like  pre law stuff so _

re law _


yeah _

 _

There's in the pre law  court _

Now _

There's like  I took um _

 _

I mean just the perfect the the bar and everything on your own _

Yeah and the LAT yeah  um I took sociology of law _

O _

 _

And there's like a couple like  random law classes there's like philosophy of law _

 _

And then like business law _

 _

And stuff _

What a flaw _

I haven't taken  the like  apparently like  you don't really have to take law related stuff before you go to law school which is like  kinda worrisome cause like I don't know if I really like it until I go to law school and like if I go to law school and I don't like it then like what do you do _

 _

That's true _

 _

Yeah _

Lawyers _

 _

lawyers _


 _

Or _

 _

CB is supposed to be a good  like pre major  if you're  or major undergraduate majors  if you're looking for law stuff _

 _

Wait why  why is it so _

 _

cause just like psychology and then like  you have to take logic and stuff _

 _

Oh _

for CB  so _

 _

kay _

or Like house of that _

 _

although I'm like _

 _

Debating about like the importance cause like law school like  GA and your LAT score are like  the number one most important things so like  I'm not sure if I should like  switch out of CB to like an easier major so that I can have a high GA  cause there's like  cause the-  apparently like  law schools don't care like what's where what your what you did in undergrad as long as your  grades are high _

 _

like there's like they they'd rather take like a four point oh in like film and media studies over like a  three point four in like engineering or something _

That's _

That's odd why is that _

cause like I mean  I think it's just like the schools like want  want the higher rankings from like their a- their average GA is high so they get more money you know _

Why um _

yeah _

 _

it's like  I'd say  I think it's like I it's nice cause it's not as like  subjective as like  choosing a undergraduate college cause like it's just like pure like  GA and LAT but like kinda sucks _

 _

That's true  favor the easier hm _

 _

yeah _

 _

What is med med school like what's the process  I don't know anything  I have like one Dr friend _

 _

Well _

Do you know _

 _

Um I should probably should research into more of it I know that  starting from next year  should prepare for the _

 _

well I should take ish prepare  like right I kinda like slight prepare right now for the MCAT _

 _

And then you  you take the fucking test and then you apply it to a bunch of schools and  hope you get in _

yeah I mean I had like an existential crisis while I was studying comp for my exam I had an exam yesterday I was like instead of studying I was like looking up like law school statistics _

and stuff like  I was like what do I do with my life _

Yeah _

No don't do that _

 _

yeah look up the stats for getting into med school I'm like yeah I'm scared _

yeah _

 _

U _

 _

ome rough careers _

 _

Yeah _

 _

it's worrying _

 _

How you reckon it's been already _

 _

Oh yeah I don't even know  what time is it _

 _

The walk here was really long _

Yeah and I I went to the wrong place _

 _

Yes same I thought it'd be _

 _

In the psych building _

Closer _

 _

But I guess the set up is in the thing _

Yeah this is too legit _

It's two forty two _

 _

o when did we get here  you got here at like two twenty _

mm _

 _

so like _

Its fair _

And like fifteen twenty minutes _

 _

what an engaging conversation _

 _

I know right totally _

 _

wait w- What's the purpose of  u- with them recording to us again I forgot _

 _

They're like gonna  analyze our like social  uh cu _

 _

Oh like our body language and what wedo _


Yeah _

 _

Huh oh shit _

 _

cause I don't think _

 _

I mean  I guess they are they don't- they do care about the content of the  conversation but _

 _

It's mostly like social  I took social psych freshman year so like _

 _

I feel like I should know more _

 _

Yeah _

But I don't _

 _

I heard social psych was pretty fun actually _

yeah it's really fun  it's probably my favorite class that I've taken  at Tufts _

 _

cause the professor was awesome _

 _

Yeah my roommate said it was pretty awesome cause like uh didn't they have you take like  in class like social experiments or something _

We did some yeah _

 _

Yeah it sounds pretty fun _

But like the content was just really great in the textbook was fun to read also _

 _

Nice _

yeah _

and it was like so easy and like  so easy _

 _

huh _

I didn't uh I mean I did go to class because it was fun honestly _

but like  it's pretty easy _

 _

that's pretty nice _

 _

U _

 _

Have you finished your like  distribution requirements _

 _

for just school or like _


Yeah just like school _

 _

I mean have you finished like h- h- how far along are  you _

What do we need English  that's  writing that's done _

Um  yeah _

 _

And then like _

and Then world civ _

 _

What counts as a world civ again do culture classes count _

yeah _

 _

I like get those  I think I get those done like  mm soon ish _

 _

cause I think they also count for like towards your language right  if you take like four courses of a language and then two courses of a culture _

Yeah I think I  I mean I kinda screwed up cause I thought I would be jun- done with Chinese  last semester but like  I I apparently they don't count like together I took Chinese cinema freshman year _

mhm _

 _

and then Chinese one and two and I thought that was it cause I took French  I'd passed out of three semesters of French so that would been six total semesters  but like apparently you have to get to at least  Chinese three before _

 _

cause you need like  three semesters of two languages to pass out _

O _

But then like  now I can use the Chinese cinema as my world civ  so I'm done with that _

 _

but And then after world civ so this will natural sciences _

 _

Which I _

 _

probably don't need to worry about _

yeah _

 _

Yeah _

cause I took like f _

yeah _

you're gonna take like fifty _

 _

And then _

 _

and like social sciences humanities and arts _

 _

what counts as a social science again _

 _

I don't remember _

it's like psychology sociology _

Oh yep  that's definitely done soon _

yeah _

 _

Arts _


And math there's math °also° _

 _

∬oh fuck man∬ that's sta- don't z stats co̲unts as math, _

I think this counts as m̲ath, yeah _

 _

yeah t- this counts  _

Well  this I mean our the class that we're both in, _


yeah _


 _

Art classes _

oh _

 _

  Oh  considering taking psychology of music I think it counts as  both like a psych class  _

Yeah I think I might take that next semester _

 _

The it doesn't count as psych and as a  art class _

I think so _

 _

oh yeah _

 _

And like  I'm thinking about minoring in music _

 _

minoring in Music _

like a very _


 _

Music theory is there someone named  is is there a curt in your class _

Yeah  Curt's cool _

 _

yeah Curt's pretty nice  maybe he's _

The  music theory is like _

 _

retty fun right  the professor is really cool but like if I didn't already like I just played piano for like ten years but _

 _

For just like ten years _

yeah if I did _

that's that's a lot _

 _

I did that if I hadn't done that I feel like  I would have dropped it after the first week cause it's like  pretty like hard to pick up _

 _

wait playing piano counts as a hobby _

Yeah I know I totally forgot I had there just like coming to me _

what _

Ten years you forgot _

Yeah I mean I played piano and I play um  trumpet and I played  guitar for little I played violin for a little _

Wow that's  that's a lot of music  there _

Yeah  I forgot _

That's that's that's quite A big part of your hobby _

I forgot my entire life _

yeah _

 _

Ten years _

Um yeah  I mean I was in marching band and stuff in high school _

 _

That's pretty cool _

Yeah _

it's a  big part of your life that you just forgot _

I know I Just like  once I got to tufts I lost all identity _

holy shit _

 _

Uh  so you still still sticking with your instruments right _

 _

damn that's a lot of instruments _

I think for _

 _

The music minor you have to like plan an ensemble  for your _

 _

mm _

Hey take private lessons for  like two semesters _

 _

I'm glad you stuck with the I'd  I  had I played chello but I I gave up after high school _

chello chello's a cool instrument _

 _

Yeah but I was like really bad and I didn't take any private lessons and so I like _

 _

just like stayed at this at a crap level _

 _

I wish I had  taken private lessons for trumpet instead of piano cause like  I wish I was better at trumpet and like I don't need to be that good at piano to like have fun with it _

 _

Yea _

um _

 _

I was the  the drum major  in my high school he  like the person that conducts on the field _

 _

Oh oh well I wouldn't know cause I we didn't have a marching band in my school _

 _

Our program was like _

 _

probably one of the biggest in like _

 _

the area _

 _

that's pretty s- _

it was like _

Yeah _

um There's like practice rooms in Granoff _

Granoff _

mm _

Yeah _

and that's like you have to  for music theory like there's a lot of  like you can give us  he gives us packets  and like you have to like figure out the chords and stuff so like you just go to the practice rooms to do that _

 _

Wait a me isn't in music theory _

 _

Do you guys don't make your own compositions do you no _

Umm _

or is it a s- is it a different class _

mm there's like a final project that you can  but like  they made their songwriting there's a songwriting class _

Like  I feel like _

 _

I haven't like not a lot of people from  like taking classes  this semester which I did a lot last year _

 _

I mean I guess to be fair psych stats is like  too large _

 Yeah stats is like too big _

To talk to people _

Linguistics is like ninety plus  and then _

but yeah you don't even go to linguistics _

 _

 _

I mean my friends and  my roommates in KA  the  the bottom  culture chair _

 _

He calls images like every week _

 _

yeah I mean itt's like  it's like a different  environment to what I've been used like last year I just like  hung out with white people _

 _

oh really  last year I was just  hanging out with Asians mostly _

yeah _

Yeah _

 _

probably because we all like  had common interests _

 _

I  mean I wish I had joined I'd just joined to see like this semester I wish I had joined earlier _

mhm _

 _

That's because well at least you joined now so you can still experience it _

Yeah _

 _

Vietnamese do I know of anyone in there _

Yea _

 _

I don't think I know anyone _

 _

You a party person _

 _

like occasionally _

 _

how about you _

 _

no you're not _

No I haven't gone to  a single party _

oh really  they're like they're not that great  like Tufts parties are pretty like  bad honestly _

Yeah I heard s- I I read a post and _

I mean it's like it _

people are always like  they're like the goal is like to go to a frat and like have fun and stuff but then like that every time I go like I go with my friends and then they're all like  itching to leave this as soon as we get there like _

 _

I don't know _

Is it that bad I mean read a person on like Tufts secrets to like  misses shit on parties here at tufts but I don't know _

yeah I mean they like  they're not great just cause and there was whole like frat controversy stuff and then like  now they're just like  not that fun  I can't say certain scene that you have to  be a part of _

That's true  I can't relax at parties it's like too much going on for me to chill out _

yeah _

 _

Can you the private and like small parties but  the ones a _

 _

yeah _

yeah I feel that _

 _

have you ever gone clubbing before _

 _

clubbing no _

 _

Yeah I went once and it was no _

it's like that's  like the as-  The antithesis of what I want too _

 It's like _

It's like it's horrible  so loud so many people _

Yeah clubs are kinda _

 _

I couldn't do that _

 _

No  yeah it's _

 _

Yeah _

 _

mm Do you think that  guy is like sitting there is he like left and he's coming  coming back _

I don't know _

 _

I think he probably left cause he said I'll come get you in a half  hour like _

oh that's true maybe he's on a lunch break or something _

yeah _

 _

hm _

yeah _

 _

I wonder what other stuff because  I feel like I'm in a movie _

 _

I know right this is such like _

This like reminds me of there's that one scene in Thor or something _

 _

where like a little can loki showed up to meet him and there's like  someone's dead like _

 _

someone's dead _


it was such a convoluted _

 _

like _

 _

Maybe there was a scene I don't know it's been a lost the saw thor _

 _

uh I think the new one came out _

 _

oh ragnarok _

thor ragnarok yeah _


mm _

 _

head it was supposed to be good  I want I mean  I used to watch a lot more movies but like  recently I just don't have time _

That's true  it's time consuming  isn't like  is thor supposed to die or something _

 _

I think that's the rumor _

 _

I mean like but it doesn't seem like the kind of vibe _

cause like _

 _

Like the move like the trailers the stuff seems like very like  guardians of the the galaxy kind of _

mm That's true _

 _

cause I _

I like  the story I think from the comics is that in ragnarok thor dies _

Yea _

 _

so _

 _

I don't _

How  show that  in like was Hulk even supposed to be in Ragnarok _

I have no idea _

How is  how do you get there why is Bruce Banner's in _

Yeah _

It's like pretty crazy I don't know why  I I like Marvel Marvel movies like kind of soured on me recently _

 _

How come  I mean I recently saw piderman homecoming  that was like pretty nice _

 _

cause they're about they've all been kind of the same I mean I haven't watched  I watched like doctor strange and I was like  it like pretty average _

pretty average _

so _

okay _

yeah _

 _

like we can either not like bad but like they're not like  innovative _

mm _

that's true _

Like they used to be _

I mean at least they're not as bad as the DC movies _

yeah Of course I  mean wonder woman is actually really good _

I haven't seen wonder I want to see it though _

it was really good _

yeah _

I liked it a lot _

 _

hey _

 _

It was pretty long I feel like  but like I didn't really notice _

 _

how long it was _

 _

should probably go see it sometime _

 _

Yeah _

 _

Have you seen it _

 _

I'm Not a horror  movie guy _

The clown fuckery _

 _

I'm not a horror movie guy  I mean not that not that I get scared but like I just like  they're not that  appealing to me _

 _

How come _

 _

Is like pretty boring it's just like a lot of it is like jump scares and like  relying on like certain tricks to make sure _

 _

That's true  though I think  I think it's based on like a novel like tephen king's novel or something _

 _

I heard it's good I mean I feel like if I watched it I'd probably enjoy it but like _

 _

I wouldn't go out of my way _

it's like decent _

 _

It like it's more of like a story with like  a scary story  so it's not like a shitty plot _

 _

oh _

though I hate clowns though _

it makes me hate clowns even more _

Yeah I h- I ha  when I was a  when I was like seven or eight it wasn't  at like a show and they had like a clown  show off like in the intermission and like he did this act and he pi- he picked me I was like sitting on the edge  on like aisle _

Yeah _

And he like picked me up and vacuumed me _

vacuumed you _


Like he had a  hand vacuum and he like vacuumed me for some bit and I was like _

 _

What _

I hate clowns forever _

 _

The clown that vacuumed me _

and like recently _

 _

No I mean _

I haven't seen like a clown in like an like an actual clown _

Yeah I mean I feel like it's just a  it's a pretty outdated phenomenon _

It's a good dying profession _

Yeah _

 _

He had to go to clown school _

                                                                                                                                                                                        Yeah _

                                                                                                                                      Oh really _

 _

What was the other one biology _

         °o° _

biology _

That's a pretty good one to have _

 _

Yeah yeah uh _

          I have a lot of respect for that because of the amount that I would be bad at it _

 _

          would be astronomical hhh _

 _

I bet you could do it I mean it's honestly just like  memorizing patterns  and then applying those patterns to other things  and like once you understand like how something _

                                                                                                                                                                   ↑That does make it sound pretty good _

Yeah so like once you learn how to play the biology game _

Yeah _

like you're good it's like orgo like _

for English once you know how to read  ↑you're set _

 _

see that's what I'm struggling with right now oh my god I _

                    ↑you're really good haha haha _

Oh my god I  am questioning my like general  reading comprehension  comprehension I have to like present on these two like  uh one ten page reading and one twenty page reading for my class on Wednesday  I spent  literally  all of aturday trying to read these thirty pages  and I just like and they were so simple they were like  ethnographic  just like a story and I was just like  so  I don't know I I think like I'm a senior in college but I still like can't  comprehend readings _

Do you ever have to write essays for any of your classes _

Anthropology all the time _

Oh okay _

o _

There you go _

I mean I used to be able to do it I think somewhere like within the past six months I just like forgot how to do _

                                                                                                        Yeah _

 _

Reading and writing _

That's my fear is that I'll graduate I'm gonna go into  uh  consulting which I find really interesting _

                                                                                              Mhmm _

Uhhuh _

 But I  don't know  if I'm gonna have to be writing in the same way that I write now _

Uhhuh _

 _

And mainly I have to also say that cuz if this is out there I really need to talk about the fact that I do like consulting _

 _

Yeah ∆yeah yeah∆ _

 _

Yeah _

 _

Can you actually explain  like  why  consulting firms hire  students directly out of college  like  ∇who presumably don't have the experience of the∇ people that they're consulting for like that's something that's _

Yeah _

I think is an interesting phenomenon _

robably just because uh we're cheaper _

 _

Okay _

Than An actual Experienced hire _

            That makes sense _

 _

yeah also I think to b like consulting itself means absolutely nothing _

 _

That's what I've always thought hhh _

                        Yeah it means  the word itself means definitely nothing because it could mean anything _

                                                                                     Okay _

I mean if I was telling my dad which shoe to put on I'd be consulting him _

Right fair _

But um a lot of people say the job of the consultant is to take someone's watch off their arm and tell them what time it is _

 _

Okay _

 _

I I mean I don't know if that's true or not cuz I I did it last summer but I don't really know what it's like _

                                                                                           Cool _

 _

To do for  couple years _

Uhhuh _

I just think you get to learn so much  about so many different industries _

mhm _

 and your only job is to learn and the idea is that a third party  who is supposed to be smart from a good college _

                                      That's cool _

mhm _

will be able to have some insight  into what someone else is doing _

mhm _

maybe they're too engrossed to be able to see _

 _

Oh okay _

    o you get to have a lot of experience in a lot of t different industries _

That's cool _

o yeah for that stuff I think it's gonna be really fun _

Yeah that is gonna be fun _

          But _

 _

Wow it's so interesting to think how like  drugs make people  more or less productive or more brilliant _

ome people get really productive from it _

 _

Yeah _

  Which is odd to me _

Yeah  at I was in a class  last year I guess that we talked about umm  bio hacking I think is what it's called in ilicon Valley _

                                                                                                                                              Yeah _

°Where like people are just taking so many drugs° to like be more productive _

             Yeah I know what you're talking about yeah _

                                                             yeah _

 _

Yeah _

oh Yeah that's another thing I like _

        What my mental state would be like _

                                       I Yeah I just don't want to f like fuck my body up _

                                                                                                  That would freak me the fuck out yeah _

 _

Like all these infections and like  yeah _

                                            Even spending a lot of time in a hospital I'd be like I must've contracted something today _

 _

I definitely got pink eye one time from work _

                          Really hahah _

yeah _

 _

it was really sad _

Because I think I like  do a lot of hand sanitation you know like I'm always _

                                                                           Yeah _

 _

yeah _

Yeah _

 _

It's fun though _

 _

That is really cool  to me and this is an odd opinion I mean I think my profession will be extremely fun _

 _

Mhm _

and I'll get to learn a lot but I viewalmost being a doctor as the only meaningful _

                                  Mhm _

 _

Ohh  _

profession _

 _

That I can think of other than being a teacher  which is what I want to do in my like  fifties _

                                                                             Yeah _

Oh that's a really cool  path _

                        I def yeah I definitely want to be an English teacher by the time I'm fifty I wanna like pay for my kids colleges by the time I'm forty five _

                                                                                                                       Mhm _

Yeah _

   And then ∆immediately become an English teacher∆ _

 _

mart very smart yeah cuz you can't do that starting with English teaching robably or it _

      Yeah _

I cannot _

 _

it will be a lot harder I guess _

                             Yeah the jump from English teacher to consulting will be much more difficult _

Yeah  yeah hhh _

         Yeah hhh _

 _

Neat _

But _

sounds like you've got a good _

 _

lan though _

Yeah I realize my plan will definitely fall through hhh _

 _

Why _

Uh I feel I mean my dad wanted I think he wanted to be a history teacher when he was my age and   we are the exact same person  in every way _

                                                                                                                               Mhmm _

 _

Mhmm _

  But now he's been a lawyer for  like  thirty years and he started out doing it for _

                                                                 Oh  _

 _

eople who were uh what's it like labor law _

Okay _

 _

But now he does intellectual property law for Merck and fizer _

 _

What does that mean _


Uh pretty much let's say  you're Merck do you know you know uh _

                                                                 Merck yeah the the drug company _

                                                                              Yeah _

so let's say that they have a new drug  they need to patent it so that no one else can  pretty much use the same drug and that they can = collect all the market from it _

                                                          mm _

                                                                                                                                  Mhmm _

Mhmm _

 _

= my dad makes sure that when that patent is challenged by another company  let's say Merck thinks that oh fizer came out with something but it's = too similar to ours _

                                                                                                                                               Mhmm _

 _

Mhm _

and they don't want it to be sold to anyone else  my dad will go in and be like ↑errerererer _

 _

Hhh and pretty much make sure  that Merck uh keeps their patent and that fizer can't sell whatever they sold _

Wow _

 _

Yeah  which there are _

 _

°That's interesting° _

ocietal benefits  but mainly societal downsides too _

 _

Yeah  I guess so I mean _

 _

Drug companies are  interesting and like a tough thing for me to wrap my head around because like _

                                     Yeah _

 _

their bottom line like yes they're  bettering the world with medicine but _

 _

Yeah so much of its insane profit driven _

     They're also so much about profit yeah _

 _

Yeah _

Which is everything honestly like even being a doctor like _

 _

Yeah _

You go into work _

 _

That's true _

  robably _

 _

at least partially because you're getting paid for it and like _

                                                          Yeah _

is a high it's a good paying job _

                             Yeah _

But to me it's like a job where it's like good paying but you're doing actually so much good _

Yeah _

Every day _

 _

Hopefully hopefully _

                 Yeah _

 _

Yeah _

That's the goal _

 I mean my dad l my dad's like _

 _

Amazingly weirdly smart _

uh huh _

he's like a history major _

Yeah _

  And is doing things with science somehow _

Yeah that's amazing _

That make no sense to me  so _

That's really cool  wow _

He probably gets he gets a kick out of that part of it _

 _

Yeah I'm sure _

 _

Yeah _

I mean I guess it's something good to look forward to that even though like  we're  academic our academic career  kind of is ending soon like we're still gonna to be learning and changing and _

                                                                                                                                                             Which is weird yeah _

yeah i just wanna yeah i don't really want that to stop _

                        Get into different fields _

Yeah _

Yeah  yeah  yeah like um  two summers ago I worked at a coffee shop in an Francisco  um _

                                                                                                          That's  chill _

                                                                                 I actually  _

                                                                                 yeah  and I actually got fired on like my last week which is like a whole nother complicated story but  um  like  I would get anxious and stressed out and like unhappy because I wasn't  like thinking and like _

 _

Expanding my Horizons and using my brain and _

          Yeah _

                        Yeah _

 _

I  like  think that  I need to  have a certain baseline level of like academic stress at all times or else I like have all this stress ya _

                                                                                                          Yeah that's that's why I want to do consulting yeah _

 _

it's like the closest thing I can think of to college _

          Yeah _

Without still being a college _

Yeah _

Yeah even if it's just perpetual finals period hehe  forever hehe _

 _

Fair _

 _

Yeah _

At least you'll like be in it together  I assume like will you be working on a team like all consulting together as a team _

                                               Yeah _

                                                                                                       Oh yeah and it's great because it's gonna be all kids my age too _

That's really awesome _

                     For at least who I come in with _

 _

Yeah yeah _

     Yeah _

so do they do like some sort of Rotational program to get you  on track to know how to consult or how does that work _

                                                                                                                          They'll probably just throw me on a project _

Wow _

And that's actually that's what I did this summer _

Okay _

And  yeah this summer was actually  uh I worked at place called Cap Gemini in DC _

 _

Oh okay ∆I think I've heard of that∆ _

And  I had never heard of it but apparently it's like two hundred thousand people  and I was like eh _

Nice _

 _

I was  I  don't even know how I got it actually  I don't remember heheh _

 _

                                     Yeah _

 _

But  it was just  pretty much I  they gave us a project where it's like a we work for the government  and it said find a government agency and fix it _

                                                                                                                          Okay _

nice nice _

Yeah hehe _

Wow how do you like it _

It was  first I I worked on a team with the  a girl named Jing who was  out of her mind brilliant  but didn't speak any english _

                                                                                                                     Mhmm _

and I worked with a teammate named John who worked remotely in Indianapolis _

      mhmm _

                                                  Hmm _

Oh wow _

 _

o we were and I was project leader  so at first we were incredibly discombobulated _

                                                              Wow _

Yeah _

Because none of us could communicate in the same area _

 _

°That's nuts° _

But  just through kype happy hours inaudible Jing was a homie so I sat next to Jing every day _

Uhhuh _

and we had a good time _

That's nice _

But  eventually I I we were looking up everything on the websites for this _

Mhmm _

 and it was all saying the opposite  shit for everything _

Okay _

o I just started calling like the emergency hotline number  at BR and I was like ↑Hey  there's no →emergency but I ↑really need to speak to →someone heheh _

 _

That's crazy and did they connect you with someone _

       Yeah _

and it _

                                             eventually they put me in touch with this guy named doctor Able  who I talked to like every day _

                                                                                                                           Okay _

About what was I told him I'm like ↑oh I'm a student at tufts I'm just hh really hh interested in it _

Okay _

 _

Oh my gosh do the did they know that you were consulting and fixing your problems _

No _

Their problems  that's really interesting _

                              I felt really bad about that heh _

 _

°That's really int° so how are you allowed to do that or like  who hired you  how does that work _

Well eventually that we put together this entire huge presentation on  it was pretty much whenever let's say Monsanto who's a uh _

Yeah _

 _

Yeah _

Yeah _

o let's say they want to change a plant _

 _

Mhm _

and make it drought resistant _

Uhuh _

Then they're gonna try to augment it in some way with a  new phenotype or some type of genetic enhancing _

                                                                               Mhmm _

Mhmm _

LATCH

but whenever they go out and experiment it with  in the open  BR is gonna go and test everything they're doing to make sure it's not harming the environment _

                                                                                                                                                                    Okay _

 _

The only thing is  they might be like  thirty thousand sites across the U  and BR incites them randomly _

                                                                                           Mhmm _

 _

°Okay° _

Which doesn't make much sense _

                             Yeah _

 _

o  I was saying you know if we just  have  I got all this data and I created all these models that say _

                                                                                 Mhmm _

Uhuh _

pretty much  there are more  uh  focused ways we can do this based on risk _

Mhmm _

 _

and you can go for certain different plant types  that you know are more risky _

                                                            Hm _

 _

Huh _

And then eliminate half the agency's costs  and make it way more  efficient and actually  purposeful to help _

                                                                                                                  Cool _

a the environment _

Yeah _

o then we just kinda  package this  and we gave it to uh I think we may have sent it back to doctor Able  but I left for that part hh _

                                                                                                                            Wow _

Wow  so do you think they're gonna implement it _

 _

I hope so it makes a ton of sense _

                            It does _

                                 Yeah _

Yeah _

After going out to the real world I realized like so many things are unecessarily shitty or like extremely poorly run _

                                                                                          hhh  I agree I ↗agree yeah _

And it's just like  aw _

 _

And like way too complicated _

Man _

Yehah _

 And also like  I  have a theory that no one actually knows what they're doing _

I think that's pretty accurate _

                      Like how do you learn what you're doing I don't know it's just hhh ya I yeah _

 _

Yeah I have this increasing view that it's pretty much like children

almost never grow up _

Mhmm _

 but we just get bigger  and start to try to like hh run the world pretty much _

                                Right _

                                                                            Right right and have to be leaders but like _

 _

= Are we even qualified for that _

                            am yeah so much of it doesn't make so much of finance or even consulting is jargon to confuse laymen To think what we're doing is really mart _

                                                                                                                                                                       Mhm hm _

 _

Yeah and a lot of times it's just common sense or just like  make a model _

yeah _

  And figure it out _

Yeah _

 _

Yeah _

 _

Hh but it works _

Yeah I guess it does work hh _

°I mean° _

 _

°That's really neat° _

 _

Medicine I think is so cool _

                                                                                                                           Yeah right hehehe _

Do they give you anesthesia _

                 Yeah yeah _

That's better _

 _

Yeah _

That'd be a much mor intimate relationship _

         that's much better _

Yeah  yeahha _

           otherwise yeah _

 _

although I think some people opt to stay weak and like watch it on the screen  which like _

 _

Huh _

 _

Is interesting to see your own insides on a screen I can't even imagine  what that would feel like _

                                       Hm _

Yeah I'd just be like Doc you don't wanna go in there hehhe _

                                                      Yeah haha _

 _

Yeah  it's nuts but  anyway  uh when you were talking about  like do working for the government with the Monsanto stuff like  my mom does a lot of um  she used to do like genetic modification for  um MeadWestvaco _

 _

Okay _

and they were working on making like more efficient trees _

That's really cool _

But _

now she does like kind of the opposite she does water _

                                            yeah _

Make trees less efficient _

 _

Hehe no no no  um she's like the government monitoring she has her own water testing business so she's like  monitoring construction companies to making sure = make sure that they're not _

                                                                                                                                                         Hmm _

 _

olluting water  _

 yeah it's really cool and it's like her own little start up business but _

                                                                        That's really cool _

 _

I was always like  raised in this house where we were like really cool with like GMOs and like genetic modification and like _

                                                                                                            Yeah _

I don't really know I feel like everything is kind of GMO based casue I mean how I feel like it  doesn't really matter something genetically modified because nature genetically modifies everything anyway _

That's a good view point _

         o the stigmatation against it I don't really understand _

 _

Yeah _

Yeah I feel like fertilizer that stuff or not fertilizers but uh  whatever the chemicals pesticides pesticides I'd be more like _

                                                                                                Yeah pesticides _

 _

= We shouldn't ⇗do that _

Right right like I'd rather _

                     Yeah _

 _

Genetically modify something to be resistant _

                                   Yeah then have to  give it pesticides to make it okay _

Yeah _

 Yeah _

Yeah I mean I guess it's like  really complicated because we don't fully know  what everything does to our body at this point _

Yeah _

o  °like° I don't know  we We- yeah we're  just _

                              tick with oreos _

 _

Yeah but I like ice cream too much but now they have vegan ice cream so _

Yeah the problem for me is that the  difference between vegan and vegetarian is too hard for me to remember so I don't think I could be a good either of them  so there's just no way _

                                                                                                                                                                         Really you can't remember _

No so there's just no way I could ever do it it's too complicated _

 _

He was sucha steal too _

  _

 _

I hate when that happens somuch _

I know _

Because like other clubs like Liverpool it's not like Liverpool d d don't have the money _

Yeah _

To get it  it's like _

 _

He just chose _

 _

I think the fact that  contact was our coach  the fact even laughed  because like _

Home in like _

 _

He's a yeah _

Yeah _

 _

But  we got him for such a steel to I don't know how Lester allowed that much money to be paid for I'm  like  I think it was thirty two million  pounds _

I'm in  that's two three years ago _

Yep it's _

ti _

That's even then like even now  even though the  transfers now are  skyrocketing like  back then  I easily could have see him being worth like _

Yes fifty something _

 _

Yeah  what he does for a team is incredible  he'd what early holds us together _

 _

Yeah that's what I'm hoping  do you know the guy from  late lice big  kia day _

I diving watch much from the sleep of the soon I don't watch much of anything this year _

Yeah _

 _

Who's months of the _

 _

I mainly watch Leipzig in the champions league _

Yeah yeah _

But  third Thurgood to either really good team but  I don't know Keita seems more like a  this is like a box to box type midfielder  when you guys need some defense of stability  Henderson doesn't really _

 _

I understand you three so  I mean _

Oh  yeah _

Every thought is of me the next year ride and then like _

 _

The right _

arents would be _

 _

Then for the problem of sleep  there's a lot of work _

 _

Yeah _

To rough it was like you have to train them like it was nice to be it already soccer for so you if you know the rules but was _

Yeah _

 _

till the the  that's like  well the kids will get angry field  make mistakes all the parents will come out for you like  you made a mistake for like so  that's fun _

But they were like one hour games _

Oh so yeah that's pretty good _

Yea _

o I can understand that but _

Because  starting at and then even on the semester depending on how you plan it like _

Yeah _

Like now you have to register for classes only got of the  I wish  I'd because like everything was like for this major take this  this major date this and by then _

Yeah _

You're already at like five foot five credits _

Did you have your major like decided by the time you _

 _

When I came I was like ninety five percent by a closer _

Yeah _

 _

And then psychology just came after last semester ting of social psych  and it's like _

Yeah _

Who only look into this  and like I saw was relatively easy  to like finish it like a I _

Right now after next semester I know  I only have to take  five more classes  for that major _

Yeah _

And then six more classes  the other major so that's eleven classes over four semesters versus like  which is not that much uhm did _

Yeah _

 _

For for _

 _

No five five so that's sixteen over four semesters no it's going down _

Yeah _

To level  all the for graduate and so it's a vehicle  that's one open _

 _

Yeah _

To  survive this semester  the system  pre brutal _

Yeah you get through this year based on the home stretch after awhile _

Yeah what's a good crazy _

Work terms _

 _

Down _

 _

 _

We _

 _

Yes this  pre med came pretty easy  to sleep through courses my mom dad's a doctor just like medical events in the family  so like that I came pretty easy and like  from there also to see what other majors related to a  the  bios to like _

 _

Broad consequence up to like a fit like that's like  an easier siding chemistries like like a lot  of really specifics for feel like bio chem is like  it's definitely more chemistry than bio but like it introduces enough file just _

 _

That like  I can still enjoy that aspect of bio  that like  that _

Yeah  good Max _

I enjoy yeah exactly  what's that mean  uhm what more lean  towards him to say  like seventy chemistry and then thirty bio _

 _

That's like is like _

 _

Uh _

Algebra two class a little bit higher so you can go up to  AB or something _

Yeah no I feel like _

Two here _

 _

Everything _

 _

I mean  yeah _

Exactly _

Like _

 _

Being therebut _

No I  I w- I really ex- when I first came to college I really expected the speed to be a lot  more of a factor you know I mean like _

Yeah _

 _

Was like oh I have I have to learn all I did _

 _

in a year _

Yeah _

That's the nice thing about it league here  that's like the as of campus so I think this pick you up that way _

 _

Go straight on the road _

 _

There _

 _

Three so it  yeah _

 _

Are you looking to live off campus next semester _

That's that's a problem yeah no I got _

I mean next next year _

 _

Oh that's the problem I don't know  what I mean  I also started fail eight so a lot of people have their things already _

 _

Yeah _

ays there is stress  also we didn't get our numbers from _

 _

Did you find out _

 _

Yeah _

Our  of the housing  for housing and like last year because all drama  has people with like really low numbers _

Yeah _

 _

I wouldn't get the places they wanted _

How do they determine who  gets what lottery number _

Also all random _

 _

I have a I am slightly inclined to say there _

 _

 _

It could not be but _

Umm _

I don't now _

There's always like theories and like stuff like that _

Yeah _

Conspiracy theories I mean they should change it _

 _

Now I get we can prove anything about it's Virginia messy but _

Yeah  yeah exactly Umm Lincoln's they one even though it people _

I mean _

 _

Do it if they tried _

 _

Yeah _

 _

Yes the like I got a  like the nineteenth Lois of like one thousand five hundred _

Oh _

 _

Down _

o I just like _

He just got robbed basically _

Yes so like any for my friends who've real had real numbers or like not on the phone number with you  what is that that's the only thing that we created like _

Yeah _

Gives armor with people either they didn't like or check people that they  like because of their number  what's a hopefully they'll change _

Could they do a good  what how do they work that they take the lowest number and you to if you go together the low some _

They take _

Did they take average the together just so that _

Oh average okay  was _

o that's why were it didn't work so like instantly like the the would be dismissed now they're trying to do like _

 _

Yeah _

 _

But again it's still gonna cause drama _

 _

Yeah _

 _

That's why I'm waiting to  find out my number so like if it's real when I know that's not guaranteed  then I'll have to work a lot harder in finding somewhere _

 _

Yeah _

 _

But if it's high then I'll just chill _

 _

Gotcha  I mean I've heard a bunch of uh  kids on the club team  were  looking for off campus their sophomore years I think and they said either go early or go really late because  in the middle it was kind of a weird limbo situation _


For what _

For housing _


Oh to search _

Yeah the search _

Mhm Yeah no I'd probably go pretty late then _

Yeah _

 _

I mean why  why bother about it now if it doesn't make any real difference _

Exactly like _

Yeah _

eople do really early just to get out of the way _

Yeah _

But like _

 _

What if you have other stuff to do _

And also if they're going to work  or stay in summer _

Yeah _

 _

A lot of the le- they can get the leases start either like August eptember or June _

Yeah _

Yeah _

 _

Because so if they started June like the whole  like if classes end may tenth  they'll have like a few weeks so find out what they're gonna do and then they can move into their house  so like yeah _

yeah _

neat  it's also feel find out real quick _

 _

yeah _

∆I∆  was definitely not the more and draw will part  but  it's still _

 _

that's like all logistical  like  waiting around what's my  what's my future here _

 _

The employer I kinda hate that  sensation of  I can't do anything about it but like _

When you can't do anything that source _

Yeah _

That's why I would like always email them so at least I would like  I feel like I'm doing something _

Yeah I  feel _

Like if you push alarm a funny was  little  do it everyone _

 _

Gotcha _

o you will don't suggest someone single so one singles someone single _

 _

There's _

And like I had like the lowest number just like nobody  if I didn't do that and there's I'd probably be in a  double so and like the basement of like  I don't even know where _

 _

To  DR yeah 

Thu  sell them in New York too though like they have like  um  like these markets where we can buy them  but they're small 
hm 
 
mm 
They're like the nasty version 
 
yeah but that's what would be your crime 
mm 
My crime 

 
It would definitely be something like super weird and by accident

like I like  accidentally sold a turtle to someone in New Jersey 
by accident _

  
  
 
That's so funny and by accident like you didn't know it was 
Yeah I didn't 

I can see that 
Like I didn't know it was illegal 
 then all the sudden I just like end up in jail 
I can see that 
and the FBI ends up at your house 
Yeah 
and like 
 
That's funny 
 
I feel like I work for NAA 
 
With this 

Yeah 
 

Oh yeah that's the other one yeah 
Is that is that right  
yeah 
like I kind of heard about it 
yeah 
 
And like I heard it's like really good 
 
that's true  yeah maybe I could write about hidden figures 
 
That's true for the for the critical analysis right for 
 
I'm still struggling to figure out what I want to write about 
 
tick tock 
Right  I know 
it's Gonna be 
A- 
it's gonna be forty four fifty five on Friday and you're gonna be

like 
you'll be like 
 
Yeah 
Um are you writing about black Klansman 
 
No I'm gonna end up writing about coven  American horror story 
oh right right right  you said that you said that you said that 
Because they have so it you have you know how you have to talk  talk about like two or three to four characters 
Two to four yeah 

so I'm gonna talk about Angela Bassett how  she plays this like 
mhm 
 
amazing like  witch voodoo queen 
mhm 
and then um you know the girl from precious you know the movie precious 
 
alright well there's this girl from the movie precious 
is she one of the like  witches in training 
Yeah yeah yeah she she you remember her yeah yeah 
I r- I r- Yeah yeah 
 
o her 
 
mm 
 
Interesting 
I think it'll be really interesting today I'm gonna have to and today I'm t- just gonna try to outline it 
Yeah I wanna outline today so I've got to pick I've been like during class I was like brainstorming shows I could do 
mm 
 
I don't know 
 
I like I'm debating if I wanna do a  show or a movie 
 
I think that like 
 
I don't like I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to find a specific episode in 
 
like within the show 
Within the season 
mhm 
because like if I've I feel like if I focus on the whole season it's

just it's just be too much  and like I I feel like it you can

still allude to like other episodes 
yeah _

Yeah yeah she said you're allowed to like look at it as a whole

and then just like focus on an episode 
Yeah yeah  so I was I was thinking of doing that 
 
mhm 
 
Yeah I was like debating and you have ever heard of like on my block 
 
I heard of it 
Yeah 
They casted like this like  white girl to play like 
Yeah it was like weird yeah 
a Mex- she didn't even how to speak panish 
Yeah 
and like 
it was weird  but like the show itself  the writing was good the acting was  eh  but like  it was interesting  maybe I'll do that _

What was it about 
 
It's like  it's just about like these kids living  I think in  LA  and just like their lives and experiences 
mm 
I don't know it was It was  entertaining like I enjoyed watching it 
 
Yeah 
But I'm so conflicted cause I wanna do dear white people but I feel like  
 
it's  too  like  there's not enough critics criticism but I could do there  
 
ya know 
 
I get that 
 
Like it's very purposely a good representation 
very purpose 

Yeah _

Yeah _

like _

 that's very true _

 
 and like  they're  really doing their best there 
Yeah 
Yeah 
 
so I'm like  trying to think maybe if I could 
Yeah 
ick something so I could be more critical 
 
Yeah  that's a good thing about like coven is that they touch on like  they inadvertently touch on it cause obviously cause it's like oh witches and like  that's not real but like they still touch on that divide   _

mhm 
 and it's very evident _

 
and like  they do 
 
To a certain extent do a good job 
 
mhm 
you know like it I think r- really do emph- like   over emphasize on some things like the fact that like  she owns a hair braiding 
 
mm 
like  salon in like twenty sixteen whenever the show whenever the season came out 
Yeah 
 
you know like and I guess I don't know    _

 _

mhm 
I have to like more I like I have to really sit down and like  think about it 
 
honestly I  might just do Brooklyn nine nine 
You know 
 
Like even though she used it as an example  I just think it could be like really interesting 
Jake eralta character I know like we have the same initials and everything but like  he's kind of annoying I saw the first episode and like 
 
Yeah I know  he  he gets better 
 
Yeah it's like the new girl my gosh she's so annoying too 
Yeah but she he's not annoying in the same way that she's like he he's not annoying once you  get used to him 
  
 she's always annoying 
Yeah 
she's always annoying 
she just like constantly annoy 
   the way she talks with like her big eyes 
Yeah but actually that gets less bad throughout the seasons but she's still annoying  like you don't realize how annoying she used to be cause she's still annoying all the way through but when you rewatch you're like oh my god she was so annoying 
he was so annoying 

 
you just you just become accustomed to her 
Like 
Yeah like I still find her annoying even in like the last season but like the first she's like a whole different like level of annoying there 
Really 
Really 
 
Yes she comes like bearable  but like  first season she was like  beyond 
 
No Way 
 
mm 
 
This is so weird cause I feel like it's a mirror but it's not 
yeah it's not 
Right isn't kinda like offputting 
Yeah 
 
It's so off putting right 
Yeah I feel like it's like 
like 
 
I feel like you they can make it into a one way mirror maybe 
Oh oh yeah probably that's interesting 
 
I think so _

 _

I think we can do that  but it's so off putting like when we first came in I was like  _

hm _

 
I was like what are you in one room 

 
That's true  he's just like super weird I thought he was from Colorado 
He is 
he is oh right I get confused between him and TJ I know one of them's from New Jersey 
 

I don't know TJ 
 
yeah  I think they look alike him and Conrad 
Other it doesn't matter that I've ever seen 
 
I honestly don't think it's like 
I don't think it  matters 
It  doesn't matter 
 
Um 
Ten years from now you're like back  the they're doing a psych study  
 

Overall I think they they're great people 
they're great  overall 

 
um  but no but I get that 
Like when he came like  I don't know  I just don't like that he doesn't make any effort to be friends with anyone besides 
 
I see that 
 
Like when we 
But a lot of guys are like that 
True 
Like a lot of guys like unless they're like  easy going like 
Yeah 
just like chill guys they're not going to make an effort to like 
 
I don't know to like  to really be friends with their friends 
 
Yeah 
 
Like from miles like for example 
 
He's a chill guy   

Yeah 
 
You know it's like eh 
Yeah 
 
mhm 
 
Yeah 
 
for   
 
We should have thought of like code names before 
 
I honestly I don't think it matters 
Yeah I don't think it matters  I kept trying to read your shirt 
 
Oh it says Hey are you even real 
 
Did you make those goals 
 
No 
or it a come with  them 
It can like that 

 
No it's from Zara 

 
Yeah 
I've been to Zara once 
 
What did you think 
It was nice I didn't get anything cause we were kind of in a rush

 but  I went one day after my internship cause we were

gonna go get dinner  and we went we all we were walking

and Zara was on the way so we stopped in and looked around 
I love Zara 
 
yeah 
it's like sometimes it's like over priced 
Yeah we went to the sale section 
 
Yeah that's what I my mom and I always new- we always go first we always go to the sale section 
Yeah 
and like see if we like anything 
Yeah 
And then  we check out the rest the stuff 
And we were on the upper east side too so it was like 
yeah 
 
Yeah 
 
upper east side 

 
Yeah 
 
I mean it's like a nice neighborhood obviously but like I don't know it just has so many like 
 
It just makes me think of Gossip Girl 
 
Not even like  there not even na there's just so many  like 
I don't even watch gossip girl 
 
There's so much history and like just segregation tied to it that I don't  talking about segregation for my 
talking about segregation speaking of 

for my sosch class  um there's just so much about tied to it that I'm like 
 
mm 
 
you know 
Yeah 
Just like put off by it 
 
Yeah 
 
The area I was in was cool 
 
Oh yeah no it it is it's it is a cool area 
 
Easily startled 
 
um  it is a cool area but like 
uh huh 
 
Yeah  I don't know 
 
Yeah  that's nice 
I wouldn't want to like live there 
 
Oh no me neither  but they're like it was just like they had a lot of cool like stores and stuff 
 not even stores just like food places 
Oh yeah 
 
Yeah I mean that's New York in general 
  _

Yeah true 
In my city 
 
I li- I love New York so much obviously 
 
mm 
like l- like being outside of it makes me like  love it more 
Yeah yeah 
j- at least  appreciate it more 
Yeah that makes sense 
 
at Wait there was this diner I went to in Brooklyn  it was a vegan diner 
 
there's so many vegan diners in brooklyn 
Really I'm trying to  think like that was like the first 
Yeah 
do you remember the name 
 
No but it was really good and it was like one of the first times I've ever been to Brooklyn 
 
I I don't really spend much time in Brooklyn 
 
In Brooklyn  

Yeah 
 well yeah 
 
eople 
 
A lot of my  f- 
My phone just rang 
 
A lot of my friends parents are from Brooklyn 
 
really 
 
That white flight to the suburbs 
 
Yeah 
 
mm Literally 
the white flight to the suburbs 
That what that's what it is 
oh my god that's so true though 
 
Yeah 
Honestly that's what I was thinking the other day like when I grow up like when I'm like  not grow up but like when I grow older 
mhm 
 
do I wanna like  where do I wanna live 
 
Yeah I was thinking about that too actually today in class like 
Really 
I wanna make a conscious 
Oh after the segregation talk 

Yeah like a conscious decision of like where I live 
ame 
 
cause 
 
I feel like it's so easy to be like oh I wanna live in this area and e- you know like 
 
Yeah because 
Talking about that mobility that we were talking about 
Like a lot more goes into it because a lot of they're like my town  is like predominately white but at this like  like what attracts people there is the  like really high quality public education 
 
o it's like a combination of because it's well funded it has this great education system which attracts more people to it  so it's like  I don't wanna live there  is like I just don't wanna live in the town I grew up in like I just  does not feel to me 
Yeah I said 
But uhm  like that's  like  a lot of people move back that lived there 
Yeah 
 
To go back for the education system 
Yeah 
and also it really depends on your job 
 
mhm 
 

Yeah 
 
eem like  It would fit into my career path 
Yeah 
ame either 
 
but that's what I'm saying like  even at that point when you're like retired 
mhm 
like where do you wanna go like that's what I was  thinking 
 
Who knows what the world will look like by then 
I was like 
 
top 
 
I was talking 
oh  my  god  stop it isn't even time 
I was talking to Lindsey and she was saying how she doesn't want have kids cause she's scared of like the world they're gonna have to live in 
Oh my you know yeah when we were playing um 
Cards against humanity 
yeah 
she brought that up 
 yeah 
We were talking about it and she was talking about like that article about climate change the New York Time put out  like by twenty forty like  it was be like real  massive effects  um  so she like I want  kids  like  in theory but I don't actually wanna have kids cause I don't want to like  put them into like  that 
 
mm Yeah 
 
Which is kind of crazy to think that 
 
It it kinda crazy 
I don't know if I want kids 
 
Right now I don't either honestly 
I mean obviously I know I'm too young to like actually make that decision cause I'm  like  no where near that point in my life 
I know I haven't even experienced what real love is 
 
Yeah exactly how long 
What a me I like 
 
Yeah 
Family love but not like romantic love 
No I know what you mean   
 _

but like also like  parts  like  I feel like I need to just cause I've been conditioned to think like that but also part  of me is like 
Oh you mean like you've been yeah yeah 

Why 
yeah 
How you've grown up you feel like you have to I mean yeah 
Like even like 
Again the way society brings us up 
in elementary school we were like what do you wanna name your kids  like that was a topic 
I actually yeah I already have my  my boys  names set and that's 
Exactly people already 
I hate that like that so it's so annoying 
What what are the names 
 
o  ebastian Blaine I know I know I know but  I really like the name it's such a like elegant name 
Yeah I like the nicknames 
When it's not attached to certain people 
No but I'm talking about like the 
like yeah said  it's it's a cute name yeah  I know  but um ebastian Blane and and Damien Avery 
 
Interesting 
And I want them to have middle names cause I don't have a middle

name and if  like middle names 
You don't have a middle name 
No I don't so like 
 
You know  middle names are like so 
 
Yeah 
Yeah 
 
I ha- I-  
Nice 
I like the name Martina 
 
Martina  Martina 

 
Because 
 
cause I have a friend named Martina 
mhm 
well we're not like close anymore but like  we  like I don't know she was just like 
 
Amazing and um I've always loved that name  ever since 
In honor of her 
 
I also like the name Tessa  because of the book 
Tessa's a nice name 
oh my god stop if  that book  wait of a book what book 
 
you wouldn't  it's like  uh the infernal devices 
 
oh no forget it 
 
What were you thinking 
 
Well first of all divergent oh no her name is Tess in divergent 
 
Have you not read divergent 
her _

I have but I don't  remember her name being tess the main

character it was tres 
Yeah 
oh tres LOL  well there's like another book 
 
Not  well it actually it's published now but it used to be like a fanfiction thing 
uhuh 
and her and the girls name was te- tessa  
oh Yeah I like the name tessa 
Tess is a nice name 
Yes it's a nice I don't know there's like a lot of names I like 
I  als- the reason why I like se-  it 
Gabby Gabby _

the only reason why I like seb too is like it sounds really good in panish 
Yeah like ebas 
Yeah ebastian 
Yeah 
 
Damien doesn't sound that good  demi da- 
 _

I don't even know how to pronounce it 
Yeah I'll something that like I probably will have to do is name my kids after like my relatives  like 
 
Why 
That's like very  very cultural for Jewish people  like  my name is Rachel because my 
 
had a great grandma or great great gramma  was Rachel and my middle name is ophia because  my mom's great grandma was ophia  and that's the same way for my sister's Alexandra like  amantha it's like 
Yeah that makes sense 
All the names everyone's names are based off of 
Yeah 
 
Your relatives 
That's so interesting 
Yeah but I mean  you can do it like very specifically

or like really loosely  like my  sister her name just

starts with an a because like  of that 
 _

so your dad  was Jewish is Jewish _

mhm 
so  your mom had to convert 
no my mom was Jewish too  is ha-  is Jewish 
 
Really 
Yeah 
 
Her Argentinan family  Argentan family 
 
Is Jewish  
 there's actually like a decent 
oh  I didn't know that 
Decent Jewish population in Argentina  cause a lot of  
I didn't know that 
Jews fled  Eastern Europe to Argentina  in the late eighteen hundreds 
That's like a pretty far 
 
Yeah it's a  weird  also  Argentina's also connected with a lot of Nazis fled there 
 
uh huh 
After the war 
After World War two a lot of Nazis fled to 
 
Argentina 
that why they ha- that's why they have those rooted like very prejudiced  views on certain things 
Yeah 
 
Yeah which is  interesting because  like  my family went to Argentina in the late eighteen hundreds  so 
 
Just I yeah I was talking about Argentina like certain Arg- Argentine people 
 
oh yeah it's very like 
and like just the way they  yeah it's 
Europeanized 
 
Yeah and they have certain like  prejudices 
mhm 
 
Yeah they do 
Which is really interesting 
 
Yeah I was reading an article how like it's gotten less prejudiced

now after the country fell apart  cause they're like oh maybe

we are like the rest of Latin America 
 
maybe we're like the rest of Latin America 

Yeah 
 
It is very white 
 
right 
it is 
yeah 
Is has a very small population of like 
 
Yeah 
 
eople of color 
Yeah  a lot of it is just like Very mixed 
I haven't  met an origin 
 _

like very diluted 
 
diluted _


 
Like if you look at the soccer team 
 
mm 
 
Obviously I do  um  like  I would say like at least a good handful of them  like look like they have indigenous roots 
 
Oh indigenous roots 
mhm 
um 
 
Yeah 
 
but like if you  look at Messi like  no  but like some of the other ones like really do look like 
 
That 
Native 
Yeah native 
 
native so like yeah  that makes sense 
 
Yeah  so it's a lot like    I think like the government is super white and they perpetuate like the whiteness 
oh a one hundred percent 
o like there actually is like  a decent population of indigenous people  and like mixed people but they get like obscured by the government and are kind of like left out of it 
 
When do the indigenous people  not get ups-  like where 
No true 
 like 
yeah  they're just like not as visible so people like perceive it as like is the super white country 
Yeah 
yeah 
which like it is but also has a significant non white population that's just kind of hidden 
mhm 
Because they want to present this image as like the Europeanized Latin American country 
Yeah 
 
that's wild 
 
Yeah 
 
I really didn't know much about Argentina until like I made friends with like 
 
Yeah 
like my Italian friend _

 
Yeah it's really interesting 
mhm 
I also don't know all of it  because 
Yeah I mean 
 
Like  my mom has told me a lot of stuff but I still know

there's stuff she hasn't told me  and like  she hasn't told

my sisters a lot of stuff because like I remember once we were

talking about it at the dinner table  and  sh- um I

started talking about like why she left and then my grandpa was like

in panish cause my sister's don't really understand that much

there was like 
mm 
 
like no don't talk about it here I don't want them to get scared

 so like  I know that  there's still  stuff 
wow 
that they haven't told me even though they've told me a lot 
 
o 
That's wild 
Yeah I want to learn more about it 
Yeah even when I like when I s- like said on talk to them about like why we left Tiar 
mhm 
 
like it 
 
Yeah  like there's so many stuff there's so much stuff that when I was like  younger I guess like 
Yeah 
I like just didn't know 
Yeah 
You know 
Yeah 
And like when we sat down and like she told me like  like  a lot of like the whole story basically like 
mhm 
 
a lot of things made sense a lot of s- things still like didn't 
mhm 
 
but in the way I just like if like  there's like some clarity to everything 
yeah  like I when I was younger  they just 
There's like a purpose No Way 
Yeah they just hold it let us like uhm we left for like economic opportunity  and like that was like the story we heard 
 
Very generic like American dream yeah 
that 
Yeah  as I got older  since like on a military dictatorship 
Easter Easter via 
that's what 
 
And like everyone was disappearing 
Yeah 
Yeah 
That's why 
Yeah 
o like  I don't know  as I've gotten older I've learned more about like what happened 
Yeah 
I  didn't  does your mom still have family in Argentina 
Yeah we still have  not immediate family  but like cousins and like family friends and like 
mm 
 
people that  are just like considered family even if they're not like my grandparents  like never wanted to come here  and  don't  like it  they don't not like it here but they like didn't want to assimilate  are not 
 
they were like miss being there 
Yeah 
o they never really made new friends here so all of their friends are back in Argentina like they didn't want 
Do they go often 
 
When they were younger  they did  now there like too old also it's like expensive 
Yeah 
on 
 
Any part of like Latin America's so expensive 
Yeah 
The like  they  didn't like  just like  the culture here and the atmosphere is it's very cold 
I mean 
 
so  they like 
Yeah 
 
Their friends are still there and like they still talk to them all the time 
mhm 
which is gotten easier with facetime  it's so  funny 
That's so cute  
It's so funny  watching them facetime their friends they're like 
oh my god 
  
we can see you  it's hilarious 
It's the cutest thing 
Yeah  so it's it's super interesting 
 
The heart 
 
mu heart 
 
Yeah  so 
 
It's actually so cute 
 
Yeah 
 
Oh yeah I know like for us we have a lot of like my mom and I have  a lot of family there 
Yeah  because  my  grandpa  like my willow has like eight or nine siblings so we just have so many cousins there just like 
Yeah 
I remember once when we went 
yeah my mom is like one of twelve 
Yeah  like I remember when we went  um 
 
What's it called  we went to like dinner with   or like lunch with all my like  grandpa's cousins 
mhm 
 
and like it took up  the we couldn't  it was the entire restaurant like  is was like more than one table like it was like everyone there like fifty 
  
like it was insane like I'd never seen anything like it in my life like 
big mood 
 
I don't I didn't even get to meet all of them that's how many there or like 
That's awesome 
like I was like who are all these people 
Who are these  people 
And he was like how these are your relatives and I'm like  no way  that's not right 
where did they come from 
 
exactly  so 
This is so funny 
 
uhm 
 
you know what I was thinking about too the other day I was talk- I was thinking about remember when we were learning like  first generation second generation third generation 
mhm 
 
ond like one point five 
Yeah 
 
I was thinking about like  technically I am fi- like  first gen  right  in that way 
 
It would be one point five 
One point five cause I grew up here right  
 but I wasn't born here 
cause you came here as a kid 
mhm 
or  a teenager 
Yeah because I grew up here yeah 
Yeah 
 
As a kid  so like I was thinking about how like normally 

when you think about the submission process your like  they

like one point five starts assimilating and then like but when

they have kids the kids are like 
mhm 
 
native born 
Yeah 
And then you have like third generation and all  that 
Yeah 
 
And like by th- by second generation you have kind of like a in

terms of like  like 
Yeah 
oh 

 _

But it may not _


Okay  s-  so 
 
This is weird 
 
Yep 
It's like a two way mirror but only a one way mirror  Or 
Yeah 
Or  all way mirror I don't know  not really mirror 
 
Or is  mirror the reality, 
 
question mark 
 
Isn't it by definition a reflection of reality? 
 
Whatever you whatever you think man 
 
If you could see through it would  it would just be a no way mirror right,  a zero way mirror? 
 
I guess, yeah 
 
Or a one, 
 
Are one way mirrors the one that you can see through? 

 
A- from one side  but  not the other side?, 
This is an existential conversation we're having 
Yeah I feel like it probably would cause a two-way mirror would be reflective on both sides and you wouldn't be able to see much through it 
 
astute 
 
Astute, sir 
 
This room is weird  I feel like I'm in a padded room 
 
I feel like you're in front of a green screen and I should be seeing like  some kind of like 
 
Like some nice visuals in the back 
Interesting background 
yeah  there  personal question for you  if you could be in front of any green screen background what would it be? 
 
I quite like the green in the background  green's my favorite color  I think I' m just happy with this 
 
Man of simplicity 
What would you 
wow 
Would you prefer to be in front of  fake  backgrounds, 
well see 
 
Neon green disturbs me 
 
We can't be friends then 
 
Fine that's fine I don't 
 
Neon green is like the third best green 
No 
Yeah absolutely 
Muted colors are always the most elegant what are you talking about 
Muted colors like 

 
What what's a muted what would youeven consider a muted color, 
Like 
like forest green is an acceptable green because it's not like in your face you know,  it's like a polite green that asks you how are you, and doesn't like punch you in the face like neon green does 
 
On one hand I agree because forest green is obviously the best green 
Of course you agree because I'm always right 
 
I- I would say it's more that forest green is just the best green 
 
Neon green sucks 
That being said  that being said 
 
neon green is one of the best greens but it's not the best but it's it's close 
No  you're wrong 
You're wrong 
 
The tree  wait do you have a tree too? 
 
Yes?, I think  so if you count tha-  yeah that's a tree 
Yeah we have like mirror rooms kinda weird  there's even a  weird yellow paper in the bottom  corner on both 
 
Interesting 
 
Oh I think they meant for it to be like this  to seem like um okay  
It's like a mirror except for it's  you and not me in the mirror 
Yup 
 
That's weird 
 
It's kinda like you're talking to yourself but you're hallucinating  it's me 
 
e 
 
Mhm 
 
I like the  the green uh on the leaves though is like the best green 
 
Very observant  What kind of shade is that- what would you call that? 
 
Leaf green ?, 
 
Very descriptive as well 
You should- you should be an artist like you're just the creativity is just like  oozing today 
Yeah 
 
You know when you're stuck in a  in a large pad box it's hard to be creative 
 
I- yeah I can understand the pain 
 
This is crazy  are you going to Winter Ball tonight? 
 
I don't know I was thinking about it  why?, 
 
I am  also thinking about it but I probably 
 
I don't think I'm gonna go ?, 
 
Yeah I mean 
Because it's ten dollars and that's a lot of dollars  but  on the other hand like 
Typical student huh, 
Yeah but like on the other hand like it's an experience and like you shouldn't miss out on experiences if you have the choice I feel like 
That's true 
 
but then some experiences are better than others  and I don't know a- the quality of this experience because I've heard that it's less of a dance and more of a concert,  and that doesn't sound very 
 
Enticing 
Appealing 
Yeah  I feel that 
 
Dancing is fun though 
 
I can't say I feel that 
 
We'll convert you  there's  everyone can dance I don't like pe- people who are like oh I can't d-  everyone can dance 
I can't dance 
Yes you can 
I can't I can't dance 
Okay 
Well 
Next time there's a party we'll fix this 
Okay I can dance I can dance  but I can't dance well  like  at all 
Baloney  please 
 
Although you made a good point like  it might be an experience but it's not  necessarily the best experience for my night 
There we go  you know what's a better experience?,  dancing 
 
Yeah but dancing will be included in that experience so I feel like 
No Concert dancing is different that's like swaying and being boring that's not 
Yeah 
 
That's not dancing? 
It doesn't count 
I can't dance then 
Then I- we'll fix it  that's fine 
 
What if I'm allergic 
 
You can't be allergic to dancing what ?, 
 
I know a girl who is allergic to  fluorescent lights, 
 
Okay well you're not allergic to dancing 
Yeah  so 
and if you have an allergic reaction I will take you to the hospital so  it's on me 
yeah I'm 
 
Yeah I'll blame you 
 
Okay 
If you killed me 
that's fine 
oison me 
 
I'll 
Y- 
m- muahaha 
whatever the aller-  what would you call it if you give someone what they're allergic to  is it poisoning ?  yeah probably not poisoning 
What would we call that reaction hyper  motor ptosis 
 
Hyper motor ptosis 

Boom 
 
I like the pto 
Thank you 
That's the best part of it  the pto 
 
I'm allergic to mold and I never know whether I should put that down when it says are you allergic to food or not  cause like there's mold in food like I can't eat irate's Booty 
 
I do but I- I can't 
Really? 
I shouldn't 
You- you rebel  wow 
Yeah I get hives  it's bad 
 
It's my body telling me not to do it 
it's like um in The Office  they were like there is like an episode where they asked them to put down their diseases so they c- they can be covered by insurance  and the receptionist is like  um I wanna make up fake diseases she's like  she's like what would you call that if my teeth turn to liquid and then drip down the bottom of my throat and the guy's like um  that's real  that's hydrodentroplosion and she's like 
 
astute 
 
Wait that's real,  no that's not real yeah yeah no shot that's real no shot that's real 

No it's not real 
Course it's not real 
 
In context it could have been real but 
omeone- you don't know  everything Everything can be real 
Yeah I- Yeah I'd 
Well I mean I'm pretty sure that like your teeth can't just liquify but like other than that 
What do you  know,  You're not a doctor 
 
You have  you have no knowledge the world 
Yeah you're right 
you're right 
 
I know 
 
That's a good point 
as always 
 
I'm on a roll today 
As always 
my dad always used to say 
 
I- I- I'm always right except for the one time I thought I was wrong  but I was actually right 
I know! Oh my god I remember that quote I don't know where I saw that too but it was from somewhere 
Yeah My dad definitely didn't make that up so we got it from somewhere for sure 
Like a book or something 
 
Yeah 
But like you know you can never trace dad wisdom 
My dad likes reciting quotes too but up until the age of  probably fifteen I just wholeheartedly believed that he made all of those up  and then I was gravely disappointed 
 
Yeah the first time that you see a dad joke  elsewhere like not from your dad you're just like  I've been cheated 
 
I've been lied to 
It's 
it's interesting cause I mean  Russian dads are different they're- they don't make dad jokes they're like 
 
Melancholy and at times very  serious  but 
Russian dads, 

They have their moments 
I've never met a Russian dad  or like a Russian person 
I know it's it's an ex- well hi but it's an experience 
hi 
 
Yeah  it's interesting 
 
I think there are probably 
 
There are probably like 
 
Maybe three or four like 
 
Like primarily Russian  in descent  families from like my town 
 
there's so few 
Russian in descent 

Yeah like Ru- like you know like Russian 
 
Mhm 
you know 
gotcha yeah  it's actually Boston's a pretty popular town for Russians Boston Long Island 
 
I don't live in Boston though I live in the white suburbs 
 
Whatever 
The all white suburbs like  ninety eight point two percent white   like ac- you think I'm kidding but like actually  my friend  I have  I have a friend who's Filipino  and he has like five people in his family  and we were just looking on like the wikipedia page one day for Danvers and we were just like  oh  it looks like there's a  like a point one percent Filipino population and then we like we're like oh let's just do the math and it turned out there are like eight Filipino people in Danvers 
 
Amazing 
And that they're like family of five is five of them  which is hilarious  And I- I'm pretty  sure they've since moved so like 
 
They were like 
Other and then there were three yeah 
But yeah 
 
did you know that the Russians made their own version of Winnie the ooh  and it's terrifying  and I was really scared of it, 
I didn't know they d- did that but I'm not surprised it's terrifying 
have to show it to you because it's really scary 
 
I- I was afraid of it when I was little 
Is it like 
Had a love hate relationship 
Wait is it like still Winnie the ooh but 
 
It's like their own their own version of Winnie the ooh like a cartoo- like it's their cartoon but  it 
 
Is it still  uh a pooh? 
 
It is a bear but it's 
A pooh 
 
It's 
A pooh 
 

Yeah 
It is definitely a pooh 
Winnie the ooh 
But  yes 
But not Winnie but not Winnie 
But 
well actually it's Vinnie ooh  but 
 

But 
It's kind of the same but then like okay he's not yellow and he doesn't have that cute red little t-shirt, no he's like this  dark  round thing with like white eyes and little pupils  uh it's scary 
 
Yeah 
 
He he also does a lot of He does a lot of intres- 
Is it like a raccoon? 
He kind- yeah kinda  And he uses a lotta- he does a lot introspection because 
 

 
Yeah  those Russians and their thinking 
Yeah too much too much thinking 
 
And their inexhaustible  manpower  that's all they have 
Yeah 
Their thinking and their millions of people who they're willing to throw at  problems 
Yes 
Until the problem is solved 
 
Indeed 
Russia 

That's so 
 
Also our group our grandparent like are my two  grandfathers actually knew each other  before that  because they went to school together 
 
Wow 
He is 
I was a real like a small like 
mall  yeah yeah 
Yeah 
 
o 
 
I don't think you have any cool stores like that 
 
I'm just cooler than you I'm sorry 
Yeah like evidently 
I I know it's yeah I know it's a di sappointment but yeah 
I was your family as 
Now you know 
 
No Verne 
That wasn't even a shot that was he was shot 
burn shots fi- But I I'm so offended  I don't even 
 
  
I don't even know how to 
I'm having too many feelings 
 
If you go to take a break and uhm crash 
yeah 
 
I would feel  but no I wouldn't feel but I mean it's all it that well that i t wasn't even meant that way at all 
you wouldn't even feel ba- 
Do you  feel  while 
Well I mean  if you're crying out I  have likea 
Good an ice cold heart 
 
Could just 
There's like a baseline of like sadness like empathy maybe but 
Well 
 
I don't think it's 
 
deserves so 
Empathy is very important and it's a defining factor in emotional intelligence did you know that 
 
last night we were watching planet earth and there were these turtles 
Like I can't comprehend intuition 
What do you mean 

Like 
in general 
 
Yeah because like 
It's like a sixth sense it's just a feeling you get 
Yeah but where does that come from 
Lives you know 
 
How how does like a 
I think we I feel like we develop it because we learn a lot about social interactions and we kind of pick um 
Yeah but how do like baby turtles know to  go towards the light 
 
Well they're biologically programmed I would think there's certain cells in t he brain 
But what is the biological programming like this is where I'm confu sed 
What we come we're kind of talking about that in psych nine a little b it like the brain like brain plasticity and how like the brain adapts to certain situations I guess 
the one lost 
 
throughout the evolution 
But 
but it's saying that it can become like pre that they can come for it out did 
Yeah 
 
That's crazy 
A lot of animal do that we're  some of the only 
 
o should not be like evidence for like physical 
Like 
 
Like there's a physical 
 
art of like memory 
 
Yeah yeah  the brain is constantly like reconfiguring itself throughout the evolution of the species like I feel like we're the only  ones that have to develop like after were born like a lot of animals just  come pre programm ed already  but some 
 
Yeah but I feel like I like all animals word 
Thanks 
 
I don't think learning is outside of the room 
No no they demonstrate learning but I feel like we are the only ones t hat are  were born the most help  I mean if you think about it like   a baby  zebra or something will start walking within like  a day to  and we're like  just  vegetated dental work 
 
Yeah 
Two and a half so 
I guess I guess animals are like 
 
rotected by their mothers are much more hopeless 
 
general I I guess I w ould agree with that 
yeah that's true where were very spoiled species 
 
Because like animals  like out I was just thinking like  if you're  born alone you how to out of your eco alone  you just know 
 
But you need to go towards the water not in the full moon and stuff like that like 
Yeah that's true 
Although some animals were demonstrated to sh demonstrate uhm they show altruism so like if their  kid is in some kind of danger they will sacrifice themse lves  finals do that 
Yeah I feel like altruism is like a pretty  explainable 
 
thing 
Yeah 
Are I'm like 
like an imprinting and stuff like that 
yeah  definitely I don't  like I must not fully understand the like 
 
The  controversy around uhm 
 
Whatever just talking about which I have forgotten 
 
Intuition altruism imprinting 
Altruism 

altruism 
Okay 
 
I feel like  I don't understand the controversy around alters my feel like it's pretty explainable like  flick fitness treet 
 
I guess yeah I mean  I don't know it's kind of like if you are on the team of survival of the fittest then  it's kinda strange that a fit mother would for example  sacrifice herself to protect her sickly child like that seems kind of counter intuitive but then 
I think sickly it might be a defining characteristic which would  make altruism not really as important 
 
I I think I feel like altruism makes sense a lot if you View the goal as passing on your genes 
Why what do you mean 

 
if your kids are like 
Meaning if the kids are healthy and they're being in 

If you're yeah so it's in your best interest to keep your it's much easier to keep a kid healthy than it is to literally become pregnant and then like  have the kid again 
okay 
Gotcha 
 
Okay 
 
o it's like within your it's in your best interest to keep alive I feel like I 
I'll give to 
 
That's true that makes sense 
 
I don't know maybe it's too like utilitarian 
Like it to 
 
Where to look at it  I don't know 
 
At the end  world is brutal I mean there's no democracy over there it's just like you sick by 
 
Right 
see ya 
 
Yeah like that's 
o  no health care for the animals 
It 
it's so human to like  project and like after more five s tuff 
Yeah for sure 
And just like 
 
give it like No personify things but 
 
Yeah 
In reality like  things don't care there's no mercy is no empathy like 
Nope 
My role I mean  I we were learning a lot about that and psych twenty last s emester about uhm self reference insult generation and things like you're more l ikely to remember things anymore like a to understand things if you do them your self and you somehow 
mhm 
 
human beings have the  tendency to 
 
Really things 
Focus on themselves look at 
Yeah 

Not trash 
 
it's good 
Okay what else what read  I read the sun also rises by Hemingway  that was a very interesting book that was very strange because having way is like 
 
Up a man of war and 
 
Little words yeah he's I don't I can't relate to him at all of the aut hors like can't understand his books 
Other fun things 
yeah he's I don't I can't relate to him as an author so I can't understand his books 
 
Most of his books are just  male characters sitting around  drinking   and talking about life  and its many 
House of the college 
Many player 
 
ounds like college 
 
To a certain extent I guess  but there's also there's always a man  who loves a woman but it's complicated because she  is  whatever whatever  so 
 
Yeah I think that's 
 
Awkward 
 
How dare you  that's 
My mom called me 
 
Cool 
 
Awkward  I talked to this morning I don't know which cold before 
I feel that I feel that my parents are  very attention seeking 
if I don't g ive it to them they keep calling Until I pick up yeah 
Really 
I think I'm lucky in that  oh  I would turn sister so she does all the  calling to my parents you called like 
Family child 
Daily so 
I'm the focus of it'll it'll 
oh yes let 
Out a lot 
Verges on me 
 
I mean 
It's the opposite for me a 
Yeah  and plus is a cultural thing I mean  Russians are involved in each other's lives to a- to an extent that Americans find 
Yeah 
 
Invasive 
Invasive 

yes 
 
so 
My roommate's mom is just  like 
 
Really 
On him all the time it's awful 
N- No way 
It's so- and he was my roommate last year 
I never would have thought 
 
It's like  I feel bad for the kids so much like so often 
True 
 
It depends how you think about it I mean sometimes it's not  it's not 
 
Like sh- she loves and wants the best for him so like I'm not 
Yeah 
I'm not- you know like I can't like 
 
ee I'm glad you feel that because so many people who complain to me about it they're like ugh they're so annoying I'm like well you should be appreciative 
hate her but 
No like you have too understand she just wants the best for him but like what she thinks is best of him is just 
Yeah 
 
Not best for him because he is really bad at it 
Not best for him 

yeah he's really bad at it so 
Oh wait is the person you were telling me that was doing comp sci but wants to switch because 
Yeah because he didn't like comp sci so like 
Okay 
 
he sh- Okay yeah it- it's like there's a line like 
That's 
If she pushes him to go do comp sci that's not fair 
I mean it's one thing to like care about your child and want the best for them and all that but you can't force them into things that don't make them happy 
it's I mean 
Yeah 
Well you can 
Well 
And that's the problem 
You shouldn't you shouldn't 
you shouldn't 
Yeah 
Yes  I agree 
 
um 
 
I mean my dad being from a math background definitely was like  when I said psychology he was like  you sure  like you like not  I feel that b ut then I switched to cog sci and that was a little bit more  stem oriented see is like  I can  can  you know 
 
Neither of my pop 
be comfortable with that 
Not of my parents like went to college or anythin 
my dad just like run his own company that my mom like 
Oh really 
Oh cool 
Hopes  Ron and don  there's like construction so it's like actually like a big deal like a lot of work bottom 

F zero marty pants  of your family 
Well  relative to my sister  relative to my sister yeah like a lot but  um 
 
Like I just decided  uh like last semester I didn't want to do that anymore I wanted to do psych and they were like 
 

Yeah 
 
a lot of my a 
Yeah 
 
Well the kids my suite like  will of like like just discussions about  stuff and whatever comes back like psychology always like  get super excited and just like 
You feel me 
It's in my 
uh 
 
I was one of the find someone to talk about psych with because so sudd enly it sucks I have no like 
My error of interest 
 
What they live with I live with like two other psych majors so 
What we got it 
Oh oh cool 
That's cool book 
 
One of my suite mates next year gonna be psych majors 
We're not doing the same stuff 
they're all very very stubborn people  one person public health of the other ones like  comp sci comes like 
Comp sci is just  how for living with conflict people can be miserable I live with like for 
Well I know them well enough 
Yeah but like I live with four counts of people just thirty hours a week all the talk was comp sci there's like 
 
sitting in the common room said in the room 
Yeah but I have to do comp sci two  to some extent for 
Yeah but you have to do comp fifteen but not caught third not come for ty 
 
Well I am thinking about minoring  in comp sci actually 
Even then it still only called fifteen of pressure 
Really 
I don't think you have to call forty for me 
Oh 
Minor 
 
Okay 
 
As well my friend is doing that as well bottom 
 
Yeah like  that's all the talk about which frustrated  only about that  twenty four seven just 
I feel that 
Like  just things that like don't even mean anything to me 
 
I feel that 
I took comp eleven and it was like fun and  like I did well in it and I had a background in it already so  like it was pretty easy but 
mhm 
 
Oh d-did you do like programming before 

I've had enough 
 
Yeah I had like a little like 
That 
 
Just personal experience like I was bored just screwing around and um 
Oh c- 
Oh y- oh you just 
 
Taught myself a little bit 
born knowing comp- comp sci oh 
whatever 
Nice 
No it's not it's not intuitive 
that's cool 
 
mhm 
it's definitely not intuitive   but um  yeah 
mhm 
 
Yeah I am still have yet to do all that come stuff and it's makes me quite nervo us because I don't I have no experience 
 
Yeah when you're gonna 
At all 
 
I mean 
I wouldn't declare a comp sci minor or anything like that until you've done comp 
Although I- I d- I do know some comes I jokes like Hey you're boolean me  so mean 
boolean 

 
False 
 
Equals equals 
Or true 
Equals equals true because  you're mean to me 

Equals equals 
Yeah there's like  I remember the equals equals  there's equals- equals equals and then like 
 
Not equal to which is exclamation point a cool  this is all is just a lot l ike  I don't know it's all syntax 
You're just scaring me now 
I really don't like language 
I love language  I love languages but I hate late learning it 
Like actual language but not 
like I does don't at all want to be involved in learning them  I just think they're cool u p like 
that too 
Well language are you taking for your credits 
I took Latin three semesters 
Oh that's really cool 
It was like  six does is like a fifteen person class wit h like a super like the best professor 
Do you like it 
Can you like create a new Harry potter spellers 
 
No but like it's actually pretty sick like being able to read 
That's really cool 
Um 
 
like I'm  I did a what I did very little of the translati on homework but like  some kids I know like are actually fluent in Latin it 's crazy 
upposed to do your homework ir  it's not very studious 
 
It wasn't created 
 
o  no interactive 
 
Yeah I still have to take my friend culture class  it'll be done  they almost my credits from high school 
 
Lucky 
I really should a taken that Russian placement exam that would probabl y make things easier for pre 
If you would  well you can  in order place out of language yo u can do to languages to twelve like a three class level 
mhm 
or you could do o ne language to like  anywhere from three to six and then like culture class and stuff 
Gotcha 
But if you'd place into like  Russian for  and  French for you woul d have been completed on with your requirement 
Yeah I mean the thing is like  I  am aware of the fact that m ost might Russian is very casual and conversational and I can read and all that but  actual like writing compositions that are formal and  whatever I I don't have the schools but that's I feel like I would probably struggle in hig h level Russian because because you have to do everything I can just 
Yeah 
 
You know make jokes whatever like 
 
We could take like Russian three though and then just do one year rush one semester of Russian be done but whatever 
Interact 
 
It's too late 
 
Yeah I mean it's fine I I plot practicing of Russian with my family and all that so 
mhm 
 
I'll just 
A friend 
What about French culture 
One of the kids must read from Honduras  and like  it's funny because even though Honduras obviously the panish speaking  country  like primarily he uhm  up like pro he went by private schools are taught English 
hm 
um so English is like  like really his best like which is first l anguage  um  and panish you very conversational but he's like  it's funny because we have like four five kids to take panish in the suite  and they all like column out so often on my grammar and like 
hm 
o funny 
pelling mistakes and stuff 
 
Things about learning a language uhm like as a  just in your family or whate ver it's really interesting because conversation only  you are much more li kely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like I  have that experience with French like when I talk to people who knew French slang and things like that like it's  almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and I feel like  it's just  it's not as interesting like verses writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is  like  impossible but then people were formally educated can't write mess 
Yeah 
so I don't know 
 
What else whatever's more useful you know 
Yeah but like 
I feel like it's more of a  function of like if you learn it  conversational you learn vocab and then you learn grammar 
 
I yeah 
Like you learn those the same time and 
Grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost because it's like t rial and error 
Yeah 
you can just pick up on it yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
but when you learn to formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like 
Um 
At least in my fears was no actual practice so without like  immersion  is practice and  as such like vocab kinda just  is fleeting like you learn it for months  to  get pass a tough many move on 
mhm 
It's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way I think   languages are more  like gradual that way I feel like learning them formally  it's almost Counterproductive 
it sucks I hate languages 
yeah 
a healing which is  the only time I would ever  like I would be down to learn another language but I would only do it for merch ant 
 
Russian 
I wouldn't do it 
Russian learn Russian 
I'm not learning Russian 
I'll help 
Russian doesn't have the same alpha does it 
come on 
 
Notes are like 
Yeah I'm not doing that  that's so much work 
no come on 
What the conversation is fun 
That's so much work 
It's not healthy just a high 
Hi 
 
No that 
I'm already I'm already fluent in high 
you just said hi 
I'm fine  yeah 
what 
hi yeah that's how I say hi at fluid 
that's not 
That's not how Russian works at the hazy hydration 
Okay I can say in English so 
No 
 
Russian is a great language 
English  is the best language 
you peasant 
 
Cuz I speak English the best language 
You  you hasn't English is not the best language 
I'm sorry I'm not traveling you'll 
 
I'm like I'm  I'm like 
 
Modeling you'll with like a tiny proficiency in panish like I can read panish 
What are we going  full like a little extra 
I can read panish I can't  really write panish and I  can't  really understand panish spoken as well  but I can read it like decently well 
That's cool 
And that's all that matters 
Cool cool 
Olivia's uh my sister's um  she's minoring in panish  and she like I was like can you send me one of your like just readings  
Huh 

I- I asked her if she could send me like one of her like paragraphreadings and she  just  like 
Mhm 
 yeah  
 
ent me it and I read like pretty- I got the main idea of the whole thing 

I like while being the tissue inside   okay  _

                                                                        Yeah _

were you texting you better not have been texting _

oh no _

    good _

 _

um _

 _

It was I was going into my senior  no I was going into my junior year _

mhm _

 _

and I was driving my dad's car _

mhm _

 _

I'll forget  and  I was in Bedford New Bedford New Hampshire _

                                                           mhm _

 _

and  at my I knew my two friends I  lived really close to each other I like thought I knew the way  because I was driving from one graduation party to the other  and I took a wrong turn and I thought it we were literally like in the middle of nowhere like I was convinced that we were in  like a neighborhood area and then I think what's it called _

 _

New Boston road  where the speed limits like fifty but people drive sixty  and at the stop sign was literally in the woods and I missed it and I just like went into like oncoming traffic and I hit someone's back en and then he spun out  but like in they literally though like I _

 _

Had nothing like I literally never saw the other car so I went to a four hour practice the next day like I didn't even feel sore cause I never saw that car  but I completely totaled like totaled my dad's car  a _

Wait I'm so confused what Wait what is having  being sore have to do with it _


 _

Because usually when you get car accidents like you subconsciously get like tense  even if like it like happens like this like your body just like naturally like whatever but like s- I had s- that like s- is how genuinely I never saw the other car and like _

 _

It was wild _

Oh was the guy okay _

 _

Yeah he was a- he was fine I I think he I'm not really sure it was such a blur I thought I killed him I was crying I had nightmares for months after it _

 _


Um  well it was the first car accident in the past decade that no one died  so that was  scary  _

                                                                                                   What do you mean _


Because people go sixty on it _

                          Oh the first ticket on that I mean the first accident on that road _

                                                        And that intersection _

well that intersection specifically because that st- I don't know what's wrong with that intersection _


                                                                                         Why don't they just fix the intersection so people stop crashing _

                                                                                                                                                      I don't know but so I didn't even get a ticket I like cause they're just like yeah _

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  sao happy that everyone w fine _

well that and then also just like it's a really bad intersection  and what else  well like worst case scenario well there are two things that could have happened one is I pulled out an oncoming car could have come _

Yeah I've heard of that  happening _

 and like hit me in the door _

that would've been t- that would've been _

 _

Especially if the car came onto your driver's side _

No right cause like  it was like this  like  this his road  oncoming me _

hm _

  so if I pulled out like _

Then the people would have come _

        Boom I would have died  and then also if it was like half a second sooner I would have hit him in his door  but I was going like twenty five miles an hour like I was not going remotely fast I was also lost so I was driving really slow  and then if I had also gone half a second later I would have completely cleared the intersection so then it's just like one of those like things and I would just always been like oh my god  like thats so scary and like never talk about it ever again but  _

 _

yeah _

 _

Well that's scary _

 _

Yeah it was terrible  and then what else I just gotten in like baby accidents that I haven't even been driving like one time my dad and I were sitting at a stop light and it was like my first day of school at like  my like original like Catholic high school  and some guy just like literally like rammed  into us _

wait oh you repeated _

 and then _

Yeah _

but you're kinda young _

 _

Yeah  and then he like drove away  and we were just like okay _

                                                       okay bye _

 _

And oh my gosh my sister was such a  bad driver in the beginning she literally was just like driving so slow that she like tapped the car that was the only thing   yeah the car the car we're like we went to pull over to like talk and see if damage and like the guy just drove away and we were like okay  _

okay _

 _

 fine _

um but it was so funny cause we were in our room and Emma was like

 _

What did you do _

 _

But basically messing around with markers papers and _

    During that one _

 _

but Yeah I mean  um  like  I thought arts are supposed to like only for art students _

from  MFA _

 Yeah _

 _

But apparently like I'm not  I'm an engineer student _

mm _

so I still went to arts  and there are C students there also like art and science students  so like  there are they're in  there were not much things to do with the the actual arts like art art museums _

                                                                                                                                                                                                          Oh really _

 _

Oh yeah _

because they have lakes and rivers no one else has water _

 _

Um and then Houston is fun  cause this big city _

Kind of small program _

oh that's cool _

 _

yeah Like in my um  pre at  pre major advisor session we only have like  seven people _

 _

in _

Really _

    In human factors engineering  and others  including me there are only two that are major  in human factors _

                                                                                                                            Really  that's so small _

Yeah  but um on the graduating class was like forty students last year  so I'm not worried  people just might just switch in _

                                                                                                                                witch back in yeah _

                                                                                                                                                  Yeah _

I know a lot of people right now that are trying to switch into engineering _

 _

Oh really _

Yeah _

   I was thinking about switching to arts and science _

Really  yeah I feel like once people get here  they decide that they don't want to  necessarily do what they've signed up for _

Yeah _

   But yeah I have a lot of friends that  came here as arts and sciences got here and then decided they wanted to do engineering _

mm _

 _

Fair enough the reason why I want to switch to art and sciences is like I don't  I don't like computer science _

 _

mm _

 I've heard comp  fifteen is pretty hard _

                                            Yeah I heard that too _

 _

o but I have to take that cause that's  kinda the requirements for  engineering school I'm not sure but I have to take comp eleven  so _

 _

yeah _

 _

And  that is not my thing  my plan is to take no computer science classes _

What's your major _

I wanna do either bio or bio psych _

mhm _

  and pre med _

 _

pre-med _

 _

o lots and lots of science labs _

                               mm _

 _

Are you taking physics this semester _

No I'm taking chem _

chem _

 _

I heard comments like  like  I heard chem only has like eight thirty sessions like _

There's an eight thirty which is the one that I'm in and there's a one thirty  but I have practice during the one thirty so I'm in the eight thirty _

 _

My f- my uh roommate he's actually doing chem next semester  and the only time slot available form him is the eight thirty one _

                                                                                                                               mmm _

                                                                                                                                   that's kinda  not good _

Yeah  I don't know it's good because then you get chem out of the way _

 _

That's true that's true _

                   And then you can enjoy the rest of your day _

                         that's true _

cause you don't have to think about going to chemistry _

Yeah  I have math this semester eight thirty to  nine twenty something for like three days _

 _

Love a good eight thirty class  I have  eight thirties on Monday _

mhm _

   and Wednesday  and then the rest is nine thirties _

that's nice  yeah my schedule this semester is kinda nice with Thursdays and Fridays cause I basically  like my classes finish on thursday and Fridays  in the morning so like  eight thirty to nine thirty and then like another  ten thirty to eleven forty five _

mm _

to like n-  and like no classes in the afternoon _

so _

well that's good _

Yeah _

I feel like the worst would be to have a whole bunch of classes on Friday _

 _

Yeah  no rest  my goal for next semester is to have like three and three and a half days a weekend _

 _

ew _

Like my my schedule right now um it doesn't have classes on Friday _

 _

Wow _

And there is no morning classes  and  you like yeah like so for Monday  Wednesday and Thursday I have class starts at one thirty ends about like eight or nine that's fine for me _

Yeah _

 _

and on Tuesday my class starts at three M three thirty M _

tarts at three _


Yeah _

wow _

o like basically I can  sleep my whole entire morning and then grab lunch and then go back probably go back to sleep again  and then go to class _

That sounds so nice  my schedule  for next semester I  am trying to make it well I have to plan practice into my schedule _

mhm _

 and my practice is from one thirty to six on Tuesdays through Fridays  yeah  it's a long time _

 _

Yeah _

 o basically you don't have any free time in the afternoon _

                                                            Basically yeah  and so I have mostly morning classes  but the way that I have it set up  which I hope works out I only have one class on Friday and it's a chem recitation which isn't mandatory _

mhm _

 _

and then I only have  one class on Wednesdays also _

 _

mm _

but then I have two six thirty classes like six thirty M  Monday I have a six thirty lab  and Thursday I have a six thirty class  but it's fine _

 _

How many classes are youo taking um next semester _

Four _

 _

Including the practice _

 _

Yeah  I have chem  English two  French four  and abnormal psych _

 _

mm _

 _

I I feel like  the practice It's kinda hard _

Yeah it's a lot _

I _

I can never do like  four to five or even three hours of might be three hours but not four hours of practice on a certain sports _

 _

It's nice though because  like  since  our team has seventy people _

 _

which is  huge compared to most sports _

Oh wow _

 _

Yeah yeah _

 _

uh so  they don't really notice slash care  if you're not there everyday _

 _

mm _

and also like there's two different times you can come at one thirty or you can come at three  and then  uh Mondays we have no practice and Wednesdays a lot of people don't go  because they can't  so like this semester I went I went Tuesday Thursday Friday because I have class on Wednesdays _

mm _

and  so it just works _

 _

Yeah _

  Gotcha _

 _

How far is it from here _

 _

Ten minutes _

 _

oh _

 _

so we take cars _

 _

I see _

 _

yeah _

 _

Yeah I was uh  I was I was planning to try  some sports but I didn't get into basketball _

 _

uh _

 o that's kinda sucks but  still play basketball casually with my friends _

 _

that's fun _

 _

It's just like the course load  right now  I I just finished my mid term last week _

Oh _

  so I'm so I'm just planning to pick up my basketball _

                     Yeah _

 _

Hopefully  there's gonna be no exams close by I know there's a psych paper right _

Yeah the papers due next week _

  On November the fifteenth _

 _

But it's a short paper _

yeah _

   It's like a _

so like six hundred words _

                        yeah  and like a mini summary of what you read _

mm _

which is  that's easy _

 _

I asked professor summers about like what kind of articles he's looking for  because like I was kind of confused if he's only _

 _

Wanting us to find  news articles or  news  plus psychology analysis _

Yeah _

 _

so so _

   What did he say _

He he said on just anything  anything would  anything just  related to psychology it's fine _

 _

I don't know _

Yeah I need to find an article  I was talking to someone yesterday who said she's doing hers on TD _

oh TD that's nice _

That's a  that's a good one I feel like _

                                     I think I'm doing gender roles _

Oh that's also good _

 _

Because like I'm not that into biological psychology  it's just too hard for me _

 _

I prefer social psych _

ame _

I'm really excited about this next unit  because we're doing  social psych and uh _

 _

Media _

    Disorders _

             oh  disorders _


Yeah which I think are the  the cool parts _

                                            mm I feel like it's so cool to like  an  analyze behaviors _

Yeah _

 _

Um back in my high school I still I used to take  um advanced econ but this class  is considered  consisted off like multiple areas  one part of the class we actually learn behavioral psych  so that' really really cool _

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Really _

I  I really like that _

yeah _

 _

o that's pretty nice _

 _

Yeah that's why I wanna do abnormal psych _

mhm _

  because that class is about like different disorders _

 _

You learn about disorders  which I think is the cool psych stuff _

I like everything else _

mm _

 _

I just feel like it's more fun to  to learn about what people do and don't do  and also  now that I've been in this class sometimes I see people and start thinking about what they're doing _

mm _

 _

like I am part of junior jumbo's _

       mm _

do you know what that is _

 _

Okay it's this club  where you go to a preschool once a week for two hours and you have a little buddy  and you play with them  little kid my buddies three _

 _

three years old _


Yeah _

 _

And  I went last week after we had learned about attachment styles _

        pretty cute _

 _

and then I was like man  I'm watching it applied in real life _

mm _

 _

Yeah  how long is the program like for the club thing _

 _

It's the whole year _

That okay _

 _

do you gotta pick the same one next year as well  if you are deciding to  keep doing this club _

 _

ick the same what _


 _

Like the same kid _

 _

No _

 _

o like basically one kid per year _

Yeah except that someone I talked to  said that  oh it was a teacher  that works in the preschool now that used to  do the club  she had one buddy for two years in a row _

mm _

 and then a third different one so I guess it just depends _

 _

Because _

cause I  feel like I feel like it's gonna be so um _

 _

o cool I guess to  keep in touch with the same person for like consecutive years _

                                                                           All of it yeah _

Yeah to see  what's happening around him or her _

 _

I feel like it depends on what age you get when you start off _

 _

mhm _

because since it's a preschool they get too old to be there _

mm _

 I think the oldest you can be there is five _

mm _

 _

so in theory I could have my buddy for two years  like this year  and the next year _

mhm _

 _

I don't know though _

 _

The youngest age is  is  less than two _

 _

Yeah  they have baby babies _

          mm _

that's that's pretty cool _

Yeah _

 _

Waving at the camera _

 _

There's also one behind me too _

Yeah _

Okay _

 _

mm _

 _

Awkward silence _

 _

Okay if I were to go anywhere in the world _

 _

Yeah let's th- let's let let  let's pick up that conversation _

                                                        Yes  I would go to Australia _

Australia _


Yes   because  I wanna go scuba dive uh the Great Barrier Reef  because it's so cool _

 why _

mhm _

 _

And also just because Australia's I feel like a place it's just a place that you should visit  cause they have so much they have kangaroos they have koalas _

 _

mhm _

they have a ridiculous amount of  ocean life _

 _

That's true _

And also everything that can kill you  scorpions  snakes _

                                                                 Jellyfish _

                                                                       Forest fires  jellyfish  great white sharks _

 _

o much fun _

 _

mhm _

 _

Australia seems to be a really nice place  my high school used to have like a  exchange program to Australia for twenty days _

during a winter break _

ugh _

That's so cool _

Yeah _

 _

I wanna go  I wanna study abroad in Australia _

mm That's nice _

does tufts have a _

cause _

 _

Australia study abroad program _

I have no idea  but you can do non tufts programs _

                                                      True _

o  if they don't have one  I'm gonna find a way to get to Australia _

that's right _

 _

also apparently the minimum wage in Australia is really high _

 _

Oh _

 _

It's like eighteen dollars  eighteen U dollars  the minimum wage in Texas is seven fifty _

 _

For real _

 _

Yeah  it's super I think  whatever it super low _

mm _

 _

It's higher here than it is in Texas  I think it's like twelve here maybe  fourteen I have no clue _

                                                                                                           I'm not sure  I can't do part time jobs because for international students we have to be a sophomore year to get my um ocial security number _

Yeah _

o I can't do it _

My  I don't have one I only work in the summer _

 _

mm _

at home but  I feel like it would be  smart  to go work in Australia because then you can save up a whole bunch of money  and then bring it here _

 _

Wait does tufts _

To use _

 _

will tufts cover your tuition in Australia _

 _

I think it's  like  carries with you _

 _

hm _

I don't really know  I haven't looked  that  deeply into it _

 _

But also I have time _

 _

mhm _

 _

That's only our freshman year _

Yeah _

o _

 _

Yeah I wanna study abroad too  probably Germany _

mm _

 I'm in German one _

Oh cool _

Trying to do like German one two three four for my  freshman year and my sophomore year so that can probably study abroad _

 _

Eventually _

  In my junior year or my my  senior year I'm not sure  cause the thing it's  it's not only the culture  but also  the um  my field in German so popular _

 _

like industrial design wise _

oh _

German has probably the best industrial design programs in the world _

yeah _

 _

Also Britain  but uh _

 _

You already speak English you're good _

 _

mm _

 _

I'm trying to learn German _

 _

yeah that's cool _

     At at least I'll  yeah because if I'm  going to study abroad I have to be like in German four _

 _

o that you can actually converse with people _

                                            Right _

 _

I take French _

 _

mhm _

 _

And I wanna go to France this summer  the tufts and how are  maybe we'll see  um  but yeah  I don't know I've I've been taking French for so long  that when I got here I was like well I feel like I have to continue so that I can actually learn how to speak it  because  French programs in Texas are not very good  so even though I took French for like five years _

mhm _

I learned the exact same thing every year _

 _

which is nothing _

 hm _

 _

which isn't super helpful when you're trying to talk to people _

 _

True _

 _

Are you still learn like two years I'm in actually one year of German back in my high school but that didn't help because  we only have  two classes per week  ands sometimes the teacher would not be there so basically have self studies _

 _

You only had class two days a week _


 _

No I'm in two days for German _

      For  for German _

                         yeah _

 _

Back at my high school _

so that's not good because _

Wow _

Yeah _

 _

Once I learn something on Monday I'll basically forgot on Friday _

                                                          Yeah _

                                                             and over the weekend I have no incentive to review German then back to Monday I basically forgot everything again _

 _

Yeah  that's rough _

mm _

 _

o I basically didn't learn anything from my high school  still start in college _

 _

You're you're starting over _

  I guess _

Yeah _

 _

That's okay German seems hard I have a friend that's in Geone he seems like he's struggling a little bit _

 _

mm _

he said it's easy but also  hard at the same time _

                                     who is his it was his name _

Cole _

Cole _


 _

Yeah he's not in my section _

 _

Yeah  so yeah Germans pretty fun  um _

 _

Yeah _

 _

o are you gonna do did you test out of any of the language requirement _

 _

um I  placed out of English cause I took A English back in my high school  um except for that one no _

 _

But I placed out of some like some physics and chemistry things _

so that that that kind of helps _

Oh cool _

 _

That that that actually really helps  saves my time next semester so that so that I don't have to wake up at eight thirty _

 _

I  got credit for  calc _

 _

oh calc BC _


 _

AB _

mhm _

so I have to take only one other math  and then for English  I tested out of half of the English credit _

 _

so I have to take English two _

  mm _

 _

and then for language I placed out of French two and th- one and two _

 _

o you're starting in French three _

so I'm in th- _

yeah _

 _

That's really nice I think _

 _

Yeah so I'm gonna do three and then I'm doing four next semester  and then if I go to France over the summer I'll do five there _

 _

mm _

And then six when I come back _

 _

it's nice I don't th _

 _

mm _

 _

Yeah for me I'm  yeah I'm planning to do like German one two three four for my  sophomore and freshman year _

 _

And then are you gonna do _

 _

tudy abroad _

hmm _

probably _

 _

If I have that time _

 _

I really want to _

 _

yeah I feel like study abroad would be so fun _

Yeah _

would you go for a year or would you go for a semester _

 _

I'll probably go for one semester _

Yeah me too  I feel like it's just  it just makes more sense to only go for a semester _

 _

because then that way  like you don't fall behind _

 _

Right _

In anything _

 _

mhm _

 _

Yeah I don't miss my family  And my friends here so _

 _

Yeah  yeah because if you  but also the good thing about if you go abroad junior year is like most people are also going abroad junior year _

 _

mm _

 o like you and your friends might be gone at the same time  so then you come back _

                                                                            True _

 _

And it's not like  like it wouldn't be fun if  your friend went abroad like sophomore year and then you go junior year _

 _

Yeah _

And then you're like friends only for freshman and senior year _

 _

mm _

 _

True _

 _

Yeah  and another thing I'm kind of worry about studying abroad it's like _

 _

uh a definitely language problems  cause  although I might study one two three four That doesn't mean like it's gonna help me in the daily conversations _

                                                                                              Yeah _

 _

Yeah  yeah _

till  so  is the same thing cause we we took English classes back in China  but those classes  don't necessarily prepare you for  English conversations _

                                                                                                                                                                                Yeah that's fair _

like _

Yeah so like it's only  test prep _

                       It's different _

yeah _

 yeah _

 _

But the good thing also about studying abroad is that  like once you get there  by the time you leave you're gonna be so good at conversation _

 _

mm _

cause you'll only be speaking for the most part in that language  for  a good chunk of your time for an entire semester _

mm _


Can you read me 
 
Alpha  six go 

 
'cause 
 

 
Food needs to be in me for me to  like be able to pay attention 
 
No dude I totally agree 
 
Yeah 
I can't really figure out if this is like actually like a glass thing between us 
 
you know what I mean 
Yeah 
 
I feel like it is but it like  it's like a little weird 
 
I can't touch you 
I know it's weird dude it's like perfectly clear  except for like right there 
 
It's like not really a window it's all 
Yeah 
 
yeah we're In jail  talking to each other through the glass 
mm 
 
Oh yeah it's like one of those scenes in the movies 
 
oh 
 
Have you seen the one um 
 
in have you seen the psych where they  talk to um  not Johnny D um 
 
Johnny G's hench person 
I don't know who who is Johnny G 

He's like uh he's  does custom auto parts 
 
I haven't seen that one yet 
you haven't seen that one yet how far are you 

I j- I just I just watched the one where uh 
 
It was like it was like a rich guy  who is friends with uh the 
 
It was hen- it was friends of  had like Henry's friend 
Yeah 
 
And his son like went missing 
 
on went missing 

It was a really good one with like poker and stuff 
 
Oh I like that one 
It was such a good one it was a really good one 
Yeah 
it was like 
you like know the da- or  he does like  he deals rental cars or something right 
 
Exactly yeah yeah  
Yeah 
and his son like 
 
teals money and then goes TO like a big poker tournament like when the money he lost 
Yeah 
and then hawn just wins at all 
and then ean goes in and like  and then he like beats everybody and then gets the last one and then like  the guy was cheating 
Figures out  yeah 
and that was the only way he beat like his son 
Yeah 
 
It was a little predictable it was good though 
 
I mean some of them are  like can be like 
But they're so funny man 
yeah 
 
oh my gosh 
That  I watch for the entertainment 
Yeah  no  like the one oh oh it it ended  with like they threw a birthday for Lassiter 
 
Yeah 
and they went to his phone book and it was all the people he arrested 
I know 
oh my god 
 
And Then they're like uhm gotta get outta here here in the villages to 
Dude that scene was so funny 
And they just start running yeah 
Take off down the street 
 
oh my gosh 
 
Yeah  you keep a phone book of all the people you've arrested 
 
That's such a funny line 
He has a funny character man He doesn't like he doesn't say- he doesn't like have too many like punch lines 
Yeah 
But like 
He's a key character I'd say 
Yeah he's  mad funny  I'm just waiting for hawn and uh 
Jules 
Jules to get together= 
 
It takes  it takes frustrating frustratingly longer than you think 
Yeah I know I I had a feeling it would be  cause like  the writers are probably writing like every episode with that like kind of like awkward like sexual tension 
Yeah 
And they're just wait and like  they don't wanna change it cause once it changes like they feel like change other writing every episode 
mhm 
so 
 
Um but yeah  it's pretty funny 
 
Yeah  definitely there's definitely some curve balls thrown in there so 
Mhm 
 
Yeah There are definitely times were like I was fuck just happen already 
 
No that one where uh 
 
you know I-  I thought one of the best ones was like er wasn't like 
 
The best but it was like  one of the ones where I had had no idea what was gonna happen  it was like the speed dating one 
 
Yeah 
Doubt I'd that I have no idea was gonna happen there 
 
uh huh 
Um 
 
Yeah that that was a  one of theirr more clever ones I'd say 
 
Definitely no yeah  um I thought they were gonna like I thought something's gonna happen there low key cause like They like both they like matched at the thing 
Yeah 
 
Yeah yeah 
Cause  sean like copied her answers 
He copied it yeah 

 
Yeah I mean I was  like wa-  watching that one again like every time 
 
Like the first time I remember just like  not  thinking anything of like the woman 
 
Um  who was like  also like helping steal the information from the people 
yeah 
he like participated in the dating when he- she was like married to Marvin 
 
Mhm 
um  so I just remember like not thinking too much of her but now every time I listen to her talk to uh  um  hawn 
Yeah 
 
It's just it's like so obvious to me that she's the one  who's doing it because 
That's  that's how a great like mystery movie works it's like the first time you watch it you're like I don't knowwho did I know who did it 
Yeah 
the second time you watch it You like oh it's clearly that person like 
Yeah 
cause she like she literally starts off like oh yeah what's your name oh yeah what's your m- what's your maiden name likeyour moms' maiden name 
Yeah 
And then like what's your favorite color do you have any pets what's your your pet's name 
Yeah 
it was like I was like  alright those questions are happening  and are way too specific to be random 
Yeah 
 
And  um like yep now I think about it those are all the questions you'd see on like a  bank security questions and so 
Definitely yeah 
 
Like every time listen to it I'm like 
 
alright I see it now 
Mhm 
 
Yeah 
 
It was at like  I'm trying to think like  have you have you watched like the ocean's eleven 
 
Great movie 
That's like one of my one of my favorite movies 
I didn't see that one coming I did not know is happening in that 
I have no idea and like 
 
I y- I think that one's such a good movie because like I watched a second time and it's like it's still kind of hard to tell 
Yeah  it's still  it's always  a little hard to wrap your mind around 
Mhm 
 
um 
 
Yeah it's 
 
um  that that one I remember just being shocked cause like 
Yeah that's scene I I think that's scene where they like  explain what happened 
Yeah 
It's like one of the be- like it's like one of the best like five minutes  cause it's like 
cause like at that point you're like all right  what 
 

you're like what? like Da- like Danny's being beat up in like a closet by two huge ̲g̲uys 
 
yeah, 
right?  and then like, 
he's like well he's getting  prete̲n̲d beaten up right 
yeah exactly yeah 
yeah 
no but you think hes like actually getting beat up, 
yeah 

 
Um 
 
There were like gar  I forget like their there were like guards down there but the guards were actually like with them 
 
yeah l-  like the uh 
 
what was it oh yeah they oh yeah they played they played like a  videotape over the security cameras  cause like they built a model  um 
Oh cause they called the swat team 
Yeah 
That's what it was 
and then they were this and they like changed into swat gear left as the swat team 
Uh huh 
Um  or they came in as the s- no they  they came in right 
 
they c- 
Because they came in  um  when the  like alarm went off they came in  as 
The they they came in for the nine one one call 
 
Yeah  and then but like it was just them dressed up in swat gear and so they came they took the bags money and then when they were leaving as the swat they just brought with them 
 
Yeah 
Um but and then the whole time they just kind of played  a v- a videotape of them 
 
Mhm 
 
Uhm 
 
And 
 
o yeah I just remember that being 
 
retty ridiculous 
yeah it was a good movie 
 
You know they're making a  another one 
 
Are they 
 
Not it's not a it's like a 
Oh it's girls though right 
Yeah it's it's um 
What's it called 
 
It's what's his names sister 
 
Danny's sister 
It's d anny's sister 

 
Um 
 
And so yeah there may and they're making another one with uh 
 
That's pretty cool 
with her and it's like a female crew which is gonna be pretty dope I think 
Yeah no that'll be so g- is it the same director 
 
I don't know 
 
I feel like it probably is 
I don't I- 
there's probably some type of like 
 
Um 
Runs in the family 
Yeah that's classic that's gonna be good actually 
Yeah I think so too  I want to see that 
 
I do I'd love to see like some of the original characters make an appearance though 
 
I'd I'd  would be  shocked if Danny wasn't in it 
 
Yeah 
They like I think they purposely held him out of the trailer too 
You think 
think so 
Yeah 
Yeah 
 
Just like so he makes a surprise appearance 
 
yeah I could see that 
 
that actually would make a lot of sense 
 
Yeah 
 
I think  yeah 
 
I wanna see    
 
have you ever seen the Italian job 
 
no what's that 
 
That's  really you haven't 
No 
alright we're watching a movie soon 
Really 
Yeah 
what's it  what's it abuot 
It's  kind of an ocean eleven Ask 
dude those like my favorite types of movies 
Yeah 
honestly they're so they're so much fun to watch 
 
Yeah that's 
 
Also one of  another really good heist movies 
 
The Italian Job I don't think I've seen it 
 
Really 
Is it like when they come out 
 
It's it's pretty old 
Okay yeah 
It's yeah  probably older than ocean's eleven 
 
Yeah 
 
Um  alright we're watching that so that's dope 
that's good yeah 
 
um 
 

I I wanna sea  this is i- 
 
it was called downsizing?  it's like it's like a new mo̲ 
 
mm 
 
all these people who were like saving up like their savings for their whole lives 
 
yeah  downsizing 
downsizing? yeah exactly and like they  they got their offer to shrink d̲ 
 
because it's l̲ 
ho 
b- because when you're smaller like to build a house? it's just like, 
yeah, 
 
inexpensive=like you you just like  don't ha- like ∆you know I mean,∆  like a huge house̲ 
 
yeah? 
 
so it's like that might cost like a hundred dollars̲ 
 
you know what I'm saying? 
 
no not at all, 
 
okay so it's kind of like, 
 
oh ah ah wait this is a g- this is a good way to think about it 
is this like an alternate wor↑ld? 
no it's like,  no it's like this company has figured out how to like shrink people d̲ 
oh sh- like p̲h̲y̲sically shrink 

yeah 
oh so it's like l 
oh yeah 
I thought you meant like getting fired 
oh 
 

No like they're like literally live with their just like smaller 
Oh they're small okay 
Yeah 
And therefore like their money buys more 
More  yeah 
Yeah 
 
That's so that's that's interesting actually 
No it it that souonded really that the trailer was good too 
 
They're smaller so they don't yeah they don't need as much food they need a smaller house 
Exactly yeah 
 
Um 
 
No yeah I think the one example they use in the trailer was like 
 
They bought like a bottle of champagne and it lasted them like five years or something because they were just so big and they're not that big 
Yeah 
 
Which is kind of funny 
 
Get drunk of a little sip 
 
This is a new movie 
 
Came out like I don't know 
Oh it came out 
 
Maybe like a month ago 
Yeah 
I thought over winter break I wanna go see and never did 
 
Been there 
 
Yeah du- I  I think movies are so weird now it's like  s many people don't go  but like I was talking to like 
Yeah I know I just watch them on Netflix 
Yeah  people just watch them but like I was talking to 
 
talking to my dad about this actually there's like this new company that like 
uh huh 
 
you pay like  to get ten dollars subscription or something  and you can go to a- you can go to uh  like unlimited movies per month 
 
At participating theatres 
Interesting 
 
Which is like kind of crazy  cause like one movie ticket 
 
Yeah 
Is probably like ten Bucks 
 
You pay ten dollars a month 

 
Yeah  it's why it's insane 
They just hope 
 
I don't really understand either 
I don't understand that model 
 
How I don't get how they make money 
Yeah I know 
doesn't make any sense 
 
do like  unless they have like agreements with the 
 
Um 
 
Like I can see how that might work like in bulk 
 
well yeah if you have enough people doing it yeah but 
 
If you 
 
Like maybe if they had agreements with  like each of the individual movie theaters like  they get some kind of a  cause like the people are gonna go and probably buy snacks and stuff to  they're getting the movies for free 
Oh true  oh and you know it's like  maybe it's also like I have it  like I have the subscription and I want to go to the movie 
Yeah 
but maybe like my girlfriend doesn't or like my friend doesn't so when we go like they still have to pay 
 
Yeah  or like you get 
 
But if you got like a  like they give you like a card you like show it every time you go in and they like keep track of how many people  are  um  and like the movie theater keeps track of like each  everyone who shows like the card  what this  like that says you have this subscription and then um 
yeah 
 
And then basically you get 
 
A little  like  I guess  commission off each person  who uses I don't know 
Yeah 
 
I don't know  I just thought it was interesting 
 
Because it's like 
Yeah I know that 
 
And they're trying to get people to go to movies again 
 
eople are lazy though 
 
I know I still don't think I would go that often 
No like  like I would say like 
 
I think for it it's like a really good like  date thing it's like autumn it like 
Yeah 
 
Right the omerville movie theater in Davis 
Yeah 
 
That's like That's perfect 
I gonna use it I wanna go there at some point 
Yeah 
 
But like  I've been here like  you know probably five months and like I I have yet to go there 
no yeah   ame 
And like I've bo- you know if 
 
We had there was a lot but 
 
I mean a really go see a movie 
 
Yeah 
 
Maybe maybe they'll be showing the Italian Job and we can go 
That's not 
er I don't know I doubt it 
 
yeah probably 
They show like old French films 
 
This is French 
 
What 

 
It's it's French 
No  I said  doesn't  the omerville theatre show like well they show like the new  they show like some new ones and then just like old  foreign ones 
 
Yeah I thought it was like a combination yeah 
Yeah  I'd g-  they're showing the post there I kinda wanna go see that 
The poster 

The post 
What's that 

 
Um it's about it's all about the um 
New or old 
 
It's a new movie it's like a academy award nominee 
Oh wow 
Um it's  all about the 
 
Which league was it um 
 
Like either the Washington papers or 
 
Oh I saw this is Meryl treep and Tom Hanks 
um 
Yes 
Yes I really wanted to see that 
I get 
That looked really good 
Yeah 
I would totally go see that with you 
that's dope 
Well I forget what it was about though is about yeah it was about the Washington post 
I yeah I don't know too much about it 
It was like a s-  something about a story they wrote or something 
Well I think  the I think they both work  er at least Tom Hanks works for the newspaper  that like  published the information  that they got 
 
mm 
er the got leaked um and so I think it was all about like handling it how to deal with that 
Mhm 
 
um  but I'm not  again not too sure 
Yeah 
 
How a how are your classes going this semester so far 
 

 
ixty people seventy maybe 
Yeah  cause I look around and like  there's so many empty 
Yeah 
Chairs 
No I definitely feel the same way 
 
Um 
 
but yeah no thanks so it's going well I think that's that hasn't really been a problem  I kinda want to do the  assignment  this weekend 
um 
 
Mhm 
Assignment one  to get it out of the way 
 
It  does not look very difficult 
 
It doesn't you just need to find two articles and so I just need to spend the time to do that 
Mhm 
 
um 
 
Comp sci has been like 
 
Comp eleven yeah 

 
Yeah has been 
Do you like it or 
Yeah I like it it  it feels so good to like  finally get your program  Working 
Finish your code 
Yeah 
Mhm 
Like after just struggling through it and like getting  getting back syntax errors and  um 
 
Like oh and just or just like having it not work at all 
yeah 
kinda like having to figure out why  um  but 
 
I feel like I'd like that class 
It 
I yeah I think you would  it's definitely it  definitely takes time 
Yeah 
 
Yeah I like that 
Like it's definitely like gets 
definitely a week's worth of work  cause like you gotta s- like the way it works is you get assigned Homework on  Thursday 

and then basically you have n- till next Thursday to do it all 
 
um so 
 
h- How do you guys have like midterms and stuff in the 
I don't know I'm kind of scared because like coding takes me awhile and if we have to do like coding in class 

I hope not  I don't know I I  have to ask Henry see what they did 
 
He's a he's a comp sci major right 
Yeah he's in comp fifteen right now 
 
I hear that fucking difficult 
Yeah 
 
I'm sure 
 
Yeah I wanted to take  I actually wanted to take comp eleven this semester 
Yeah 
I decided  to take calc three instead I'll just take it cause I didn't want to take both 
 
yeah that's robably smart move 
Um 
Yeah  so I'll take it probably in the fall 
 
Yeah I w-  wanted to take comp ten  just cause it was like  it's like comp eleven except  not for majors 
 
like comp sci majors so it's likeA lot more easy going 
yeah 
but  I l- I literally showed up for the class  the first week back and 
 
Like I get there and  there are  the class is just absolutely packed 
 
Yeah 
Like everyone on the waitlist showed up 
 
Yeah 
Um so we were like twenty people over capacity 
Geez  how big is the class 
 
not that big I think it was only supposed to hold like  thirty thirty five people 
mhm yeah 
mm But there ended up being like  fifty people there 
damn 
 
Um 
 
e- 
 
s- But like I was looking around and I'm pretty sure I was the only freshman in that room 
Yeah 
 
Um 
 
And so  yeah he like at the end fo class he was like gonna try and like  um find a bigger room so like he could accommodate all the people that wanted to take the class which is like cool but then like you got an email from people saying like no we can't  give you a bigger room you need to  just ay no 
They needed to cap the classes 
Yeah 
That makes sense 
 
Unfortunately 
 
But you know I  how do you like the guy I heard he's  a little bit of a character 
Which one 

The comp sci guy 
 
uh oh the professor 
Yeah 
Yeah  he 
 
Yeah He's 
 
Definitely interesting 
 
He 
 
I don't know it's like hard to describe he's 
 
He's definitely he's very smart 
mhm 
that's  for sure um  and 
 
He's like 
 
His sense of humor is kind of like 
 
That's so  funny 
Yeah 
 
It's kind of like a  computer and away  he  um 
 
Where they keep because like computer science like at the end of each step laid out  um  and so it 
That's what is jokes so 
Yeah it kind of  so he  oh 
 
He's like  he always flexes like out cannot process because  blank is 
 
It's hard 
 
What what  does he like go through coding class there 
Hi it's more like the concept so like how to make  how to do repetition  uhm in like how to make the  code do the same thing over and over for like an X amount of times  um  um so it's more like  bigger concepts like that  last class  which is a fully like kinda went through how the computer thought about it or like  you have  basically every code and then 
Mhm 
 
Your word  yeah you have your code and then 
 
A lot of what coding is is functions which is like  code inside of  it's like 
 
At this  it's a string with like code inside of it so if you call the function than the code that's inside the functional run and you'll get like at 
 
Oh put 
o like  X squared for example 
ure 
Like that's that would be like a  he had the square function or whatever  if you like name your function like square and then wroteinside it how to  like 
Mhm 
Yeah 
Then  uhm basically when you call a function  M  that'll run  the what ask you to like input the number and then a like run the  code and it'll  uhm give you a number back  and so  he like to basically talked about how the computer will 
 
Kind of  for each action within that  uhm within the code inside the  function  it a like  um so if you wanted it to print  hi or whatever it like  create an activation record  for print 
Mhm 
 
Yeah 
And then it will a good  like  analyze what it wants to print  to be like okay once we print I can do that 
Okay 
It'll  send that back 
 
It's pretty cool 
It'll print that and then activation record will go away and 
 
It 
 
I don't know it that the special just gonna help me  like wrap my head around  uhm 
 
Like what the computer is actually doing  did the we're doing 
Yeah it's definitely it's definitely really cool field like my dad like 
 
I was like  no like I'm helping pay for  a college education this is the one causing did say 
Yeah 
Which is caught like comp eleven 
I mean its fair 
Uhm 
 
That's so that's for Yeah 
No no no and I like wanna take it anyway 
Yeah 
Thank you I think it was like kind of joking but 
 
My dad thinks it yeah the same way it thinks it  should all 
 
Uhm 
Just so it's like  for everybody like understand like  even though like or even a couple of is just like the basics right yet see plus plus 
Yeah 
 
Oh well we're doing python antsy both of 
Okay 
 
But like so I could  just  like now like you since you're able to code and both of those  it like enables you to do jobs were like which like eighty percent coat eighty eighty percent noncoding but like twenty percent cutting 
Yeah  apparently after 
 
Comp eleven and comp fifteen were at like an employable level of 
 
Really 
 
That's  that's what someone told me around it's very 
That's pretty cool 
Yeah 
 
You're gonna keep gonna 
 
Oh sell the rest of us are you has 
The 
 
Uhm  figured out from here 
 
Definitely 
 
o taken is intro to finance class with the 
 
My profession and David just go 
 
He's like this guy who's never top before  he's a tufts alarm 
 
And he worked in finance for like 
Thirty years whatever and I was teaching us he's such a character it's hilarious 
Wow ok 
 
He's not he's a really funny 
Wait 
It's good 
 
He's he's also he's actually like a good teacher like 
Is he a good teacher 
 
Feel like a lot of those people are like  I  don't really know how the T a yard like it is it's like knowing the information doesn't enable you to teach the information 
That's true 
 
Right it's like 
 
How will you convey it to people who don't know 
Exactly and so using like techniques 
 
To try and like 
Yeah 
We only did yeah exactly just like demonstrated in a way that makes sense  uhm 
 
Yeah  or 
 
Yeah he's he's doing a good job of doctor it's really it's a really instinct us 
What do you what he is doing  when you learn about 
o we start off with like  my present future value of money 
 
Okay 
 
um  so is the that that part has been pretty like equation happy 
 
The question  yeah 
o it's Bella Akeno 
 
F V was eavey times the rate 
Yeah 
 
To like 
RT or whatever 
To anticipate yet uhm you 
Yeah 
 
That  piano which is like period's and 
Yeah 
Then as the years 
Yeah 
 
Which is like  it's interesting 
The classic  equation 
Exactly yes like we start off at that 
 
But you 
 
Uhm to start off with that we did 
 
Mr then we did like we doing with cash we did more of class cash flows so like 
Yeah 
 
um  like figuring out 
 
Kind of like how to compare investments  based on your cash flow 
 
Which is pretty interesting  that's a more equations basically  um 
Mhm 
 
Now  oh  uhm we just finished 
 
This thing called an B and I are  which is like 
 
And TV is not present value 
 
For  yeah 
 
And IR is 
 
omething rate of return  investment return probably 
This 
 
Um  that's that's late that helps with like evaluating investments  it's pretty interesting 
Interesting 
Um 
 
Yeah like it we're movie on the bonds now  which I think would be really cool we talk about like Bon pricing  um  and like  it's the bond markets 
That's a lot of work for intervention 
 
Let's see we've had  the first problems that was like the easiest thing I've ever done 
 
You've only had one then 
 
No we had  to early like  a third under on Tuesday 
 
Uhm they like art 
 
The second always difficult  like 
 
I 
 
Like the first half was really easy and then the second half was like 
 
Like more like word problems  in like  excel 

Oh my god 
 
We're being watched  
 
How are you  
 
oh my god  
 
how was your day  
 

 
mhm 

 
okay  I haven't seen inception  
Okay 
it's just like mind games and stuff  
 
Imagine if you were doing this with a stranger what if we were doing this with Dylan?  

 
stop  
 
Wait if it was me you dylan and malcolm  
 

Like if I do that you would do that  
Okay wait wait wait  
 
oh my god  
 

Wait we have the  
 

 
Yeah look at that  
 
Everything's the same do you have curtains on the side 

Because I talked to my yes  cause I talked to my um  
 
My advisoor didn't know anything  
advis-  
really  
 
Yeah  
that's not helpful 
I emailed a person in the bio psych department and was like hello  
please help me figure out my life  
mhm 
 
but they haven't emailed me back  
mm  
 
Interesting  
 
Hopefully they do 
wait did you email the girl that we went to see  collecs-  

 
I think I figured it out I wrote I wrote out all the classes I should take  until like spring of sophomore year  
okay  
 
and it seems logical  
wow  
oh my god  
 
I know  it probably won't happen cause it's like all science  
 
mhm 
and I in even like distribution and stuff 
Yeah  
 
But  
 
honestly like might take like a  because we need like art right 
Yeah  
 

But I need to take  
oh right 
don't take bio fourteen  
 
No I need to  
Okay alright  
Because otherwise I wouldn't get to like bio psych classes until junior year  
 
But because they both they require bio thirteen and fourteen 
Yeah  
 
oh  
 
Interesting  
when I can blow into I can hear it  
 
me too  
 
Okay it's so strong  

And it was like the frats are closed what that like closing the him next year  
Yeah 
and then 
cause he he was like I 
And I was like wait at first I was like wait there's no way and then he clicked on the thing and then he was like oh what  
and I was like wait what  
Yeah  
 
cause he said he hated his friends and I was like  what 
Oh really  
Yeah cause I was like what friends like high school or college he was like high school  I was like why  and he told me about it  
he just said that they were like like they like to mess around a lot  

Really 
Yeah  he didn't spill though  

Yeah we will  cause I also  like  
 
Yeah  
 
I don't even think he know about that 
I wanna know his friend history  
I don't think you know my friend history  
We should all spill  

Because cold and you get you cause it get sensitive also if you wear like hats 
or like hoods it like can infect it  
Yeah  
