	 
SP:	spot  on  the entire universe which what the fuck is the universe we can  s̲pend our days praying to a god and even if that god's real doesn't fucking matter ccause we're all just gonna die anyway 

SP:	um 
	 

	 
SP:	Something else I find interesting is like  why do we 
	 

SP:	Yeah 
SP:	they like well 
SP:	You're like forced to be in 

	 
SP:	Any other animal so why do we think we're so much like different≈ 
SP:	≈cause we got the brains  
SP:	well but that's my thing like why do we think that everything animals do is just like animalistic and purely evolutionary but then everything we do is somehow different 

	 
SP:	oh 
SP:	And I woke up my eyes were like totally bloodshot 
SP:	I hate that 
	 
SP:	So when I took my contacts out like  I just started like with my glasses on 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	I went downstairs and someonoe was like  are you okay like they thought I was like really in really bad shape I'm like no I just didn't take my contacts out overnight but like  people were looking at me really funny all day≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	I t was like  are you are you good  like my teacher pulled me aside after class 
SP:	oh no 
SP:	and asked me if I was um doing okay I'm like yeah I just  it's not that big a d-  it's fine≈ 
SP:	≈just forgot my contacts 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	No I like I've done that before and then I wake up and I'm like oh I can see now and then  and then it's a disappointment when I would like have to take them out 
	 
SP:	hmm 
	 
SP:	What happens≈ 
SP:	≈I hate it 
	 
SP:	It's a miracle 
SP:	I know 
	 
SP:	Yeah  I don't know  contacts are annoying but better than glasses 
SP:	Yes 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	like I just hate Wallich you can't see everything with glasses 
	 
SP:	it's the peripheral vision that's thrown off 
SP:	Yeah  and like when I'm like especially when I'm going downstair- like walking downstairs with them on 
SP:	oh Yeah 
	 
SP:	>cause then I-< 
SP:	they shake a little bit ansd said 
SP:	Yeah and like I'll see  through my glasses and then I'll also see like 
	 
SP:	with my glasses off like 
SP:	Yeah like 
SP:	When I looked down down like I can't see anything it's just blurry 
SP:	You'll see like just below anything at  it's awful 
SP:	Then I get thrown off 
	 
SP:	Even worse so like before I wore contacts like the glasses made sense but now that I've worn contacts f- for a good amount of time now When I put the glasses on everything is like  so different 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Yeah like you can't go back 
SP:	Yeah  I do every once in a while because I have to 
SP:	It's a weird 
	 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	But like 
	 
SP:	It's so weird 
SP:	Yeah  it's like getting your eyes a break or whatever they say but like I  I'm like no  >that's not happening< 
SP:	Yeah it's  it is what it is 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Yeah even worse is like when you go a couple days in a row where you've like stayed up too late and wear the contacts for a long period of time 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	And then like your eyes are just generally bloodshot 
SP:	I know 
SP:	It's awful 
	 
SP:	And I hate the like the dry feeling 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Like when you keep them in and it's just like they kind of get like stuck to your eye 
SP:	Yeah yeah 
	 
SP:	It sucks 
	 
SP:	One time I  um tried to take my contact out my contact must have fallen out though so like I'm just pulling out my eye for like thirty minutes 
SP:	oh no 
SP:	I was like panicking because I was at a concert so like I got home and I went to take them Out  I just didn't have one of them in they were just must have fallen out 
SP:	that's so funny≈ 
SP:	≈The scariest part is that I drove home  like I drove home with only one contact in and don't even notice≈ 
SP:	≈That's so weir- is there what's your prescription  is it that 
	 
SP:	it's not that bad but I have like a really bad astigmatism 
SP:	uh huh 
	 
SP:	so 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	I should noticed  it would've thrown me off 
SP:	but I don't know 
SP:	That's funny 
SP:	I I didn't notice 
	 
SP:	Yeah I couldn't do that my eyes are too bad 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	I like 
SP:	Happens 
SP:	I wanna get Lazic but  it scares me 
SP:	>It was a little scary<≈ 
SP:	≈it's a lil s- 

SP:	Putting lasers in yeah≈ 
SP:	≈I know  I'm  way too scared not till I'm  way older 
	 
SP:	Yeah  I was scared of contacts forever if I contact like six months like 
SP:	oh really 
SP:	I had like an enormous  unnecessary fear for like poking my eyes 
SP:	That's so i- interesting 
SP:	um Like I had nothing to cause the fear 
SP:	Uh huh 
SP:	I just had that fear 
	 
SP:	That's so weird 
SP:	Uhm but  then I was like fuck it I'll get contacts  and that's definitely on video 
	 
SP:	Like the con  it's like the conditioning  or whatever 
SP:	yeah finishing≈ 

SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	yeah≈ 
SP:	≈That's so funny  I got it when I was like 
	 
SP:	Ten 
SP:	Nine or ten  cause I needed 'em for soccer cause like I couldn't 
SP:	Yeah I should on that 
SP:	my makes sense 
SP:	I didn't want to wear the like goggles 
	 
SP:	see I just wore the my regular glasses when I played soccer when I was younger≈ 
SP:	≈uh huh≈ 
SP:	≈and they would always like fall off or I'd get hit in the face the ball 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈like I couldn't do headers like 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I lost a whole point of the game 
SP:	Exactly≈ 
SP:	≈Actually every sport I played  a somehow at some point either break a pair of glasses or get hit in the face or like 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	something always went wrong 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	yeah 
	 
SP:	that's so f- 
SP:	except for cross country I never had problems with glasses in cross country 
SP:	No 
	 
SP:	do you still do are you still playing any sports 
SP:	uh no  I'm really good at getting hurt 
SP:	No 
	 
SP:	What have you at what are you injured 
	 
SP:	I've injured like everything you can name a bone or place in my body I've hurt it 
SP:	oh gosh really 
SP:	It's yeah  most likely doing something clumsy not even not even playing sports 
SP:	That's f- 
	 
SP:	Like I had three concussions in a month once 
SP:	not good 
	 
SP:	I don't play any contact sports 
	 
SP:	what 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	how≈ 
SP:	≈well first one I got in choior 
	 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	Um my friend accidentally hti me in the head 
SP:	oh gosh 
SP:	So it was a small one the day I came back from that concussion  someone hit me in the face with a basketball just like down like in the hall  um the day I came back from that concussion I tripped and fell hit my head on a metal pole 
	 
SP:	That's such bad luck 
SP:	Yeah  it's fine I mean it's tough I couldn't have lost that much brain cells 
	 
SP:	My friend  had  one and she was out of school for like two months≈ 
SP:	≈Damn 
SP:	it was terrible 
	 
SP:	Was a sports concussion though 

SP:	Yeah so she was heading the- she's a center back 
SP:	That makes sense 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	And she was heading the ball and like it hit her too high up  instead of on the forehead 
	 
SP:	that makes sense 
SP:	And she  lost s- like it was during our junior  junior year  of high school  and she couldn't play  or she couldn't she stopped playing after she got the concussion  cause she was too afraid  and then  she like it affected all her like ACTs SATs and like all of our classes 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	that's awful 
	 
SP:	She made it to Duke so I think she's doing okay 
SP:	I think she's doing fine 
SP:	Doesn't really matter 
SP:	yeah 
	 
SP:	It worked out 
	 
SP:	at least it worked out 
	 
SP:	Injuries suck though 

SP:	I don't even know  not to have major stuff but like even like little injuries I've had a concussion before 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	But 
	 
SP:	none of my c- my three concussions were major so like≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	I was out of school for like a week each 
SP:	uh huh 
	 
SP:	um but the three in a row was what the problem was 
SP:	Yeah  that sets you back a lot 
SP:	yeah 
	 
SP:	it's okay it was my freshman year so I was I didn't have that much to do 
SP:	oh 
SP:	that's not bad 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Are you doing any like  other activities 

SP:	what's that 
	 
SP:	it's improv 
SP:	oh okay 
	 
SP:	um so now I'm in comedy 
	 
SP:	Cool 
SP:	um which is I guess the third tier  thing 
SP:	Yeah that's so fun 
SP:	so  yeah 
	 
SP:	So cool 
SP:	it's exciting 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	is it like new for you or have you done comedy before 
SP:	I'm 
SP:	I've done comedy before just it's been a while 
	 
SP:	uh huh 
SP:	Like  I did comedy when I was like thirteen 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	and like before I had any idea of what was actually funny 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	um So now it's  different like I'm writing jokes like all the time 
SP:	uh huh 
SP:	now cause it's just finally I'll think of something funny and I'll write it down where as before I wouldn't think to write that down I would just like 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Think of something funny 
	 
SP:	That's so fun≈ 
SP:	≈that's so interesting 
SP:	So 
	 
SP:	yeah  even better is when I actually have the tell the jokes  um because sometimes I'll just write down a  a key word 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	like a  like a word that if anyone read it like they would have no idea what I possibly mean by that≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	and then sometimes I'll forget what they mean 
SP:	Uh huh 
SP:	and it ruins the whole joke  I'll just be like  binoculars I don't know that joke is  like 
SP:	Is it like scripted when you do it or is it more≈ 
SP:	≈Some of it's scripted  mostly not though it's mostly like I've written like part of a joke  down  and I'll like no matter how I tell it that's the joke is≈ 
SP:	≈Okay 
	 
SP:	I try to write as little as possible down so I can like consolidate space 
SP:	uh huh 
	 
SP:	Um but other jokes have to be scripted because I can't be told otherwise 
SP:	Yeah so like tonight when you go to the thing will you  like  have a set like something like prepared for it or is it more just like you'll go up there and 
SP:	I'm gonna try to  I'm gonna try to do it memorized 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	um but I have a s- I have a set prepared kind of 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	um I haven't really memorized it but I should start doing it some point 
	 
SP:	In the next hour 
SP:	Or so 
SP:	Yeah I'll figure it out 
	 
SP:	yeah 
	 
SP:	I haven't done a show memorized yet 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	so I wanted to do one 
SP:	feel like that would be hard it's more important I feel like to get the joke down 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Right maybe 
SP:	I'll probably be telling jokes I've already told  tonight 
SP:	I don't know 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Um but it's a new audience so they haven't heard 'em 
SP:	That's cool 
	 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈Never heard of that here  I'll have to go sometimes is every week 
	 
SP:	I don't know  um it's  this week for sure≈ 
SP:	≈it's not been every week 
SP:	mhm 
	 
SP:	uh you should go tonight 
	 
SP:	I would but we have a team dinner thing 
SP:	that makes sense 
	 
SP:	um     Sports 
SP:	We have a playoff game tomorrow≈ 
SP:	≈really 
SP:	So if we l-  lose our season's over  but if we win 

SP:	we're s- 
SP:	Yes  we get another game 

	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Which is  nerve wracking but exciting  hopefully we do well 
SP:	that works 
	 
SP:	good luck 
	 
SP:	Thank you 
SP:	what position do you play 
SP:	I'm a forward 
SP:	Forward okay≈ 
SP:	≈I got I just got moved I was  playing outside mid all of high school and like outside back 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	And then  on this team I'm just  better fit up top 
	 
SP:	that works 
SP:	like I like the ball at my feet 
	 
SP:	And like 
SP:	that makes sense it's soccer 
SP:	Skills and stuff  yeah  I'm not  like our outside minis are more runners 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	Like 
	 

SP:	Just  can go up and back all day and chase people down and that's just not≈ 

SP:	oh goalie≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah a goalie for awhile  

SP:	uhuh 
SP:	from a different town who joined 
SP:	oh okay 
SP:	so I didn't play goalie after that 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	uh cause  I cann't compete  this kids ridiculously good at goalie  he got recruited so 

SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I was wrong 
	 

	 
SP:	it was tougher than I thought 
	 
SP:	yeah 
	 
SP:	Um I was a good cheerleader though  on crutches 
	 
SP:	>What do you do<  what you heard 

SP:	Yeah like they can't get worse 
SP:	just yeah 
SP:	they're not gonna get any worse 
SP:	They're just painful 
SP:	the worst that could happen 
	 
SP:	Like is if you like hit your shin on something while you had shin splints 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	then you could get a fracture cause your shins are weaker 
SP:	Yep 
SP:	but it's mostly just pain 

SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	oh resilience and stuff like that 
SP:	Definitely  it's a big  it's very important 

SP:	That's so fun 
SP:	Got rained out 
	 
SP:	oh≈ 
SP:	≈Like crazy thunderstorms so 
	 
SP:	That's unfortunate 
SP:	Didn't didn't get to see the weekend  or maybe or >anybody I wanted to see<  but that's okay 
	 
SP:	Yeah another time maybe 
SP:	Yeah  it was worth it 
SP:	Maybe next summer  you guys can try again 
SP:	Next summer 

	 
SP:	yeah  >probably not<≈ 
SP:	≈Do you guys get or did it  do you get along with the one who's still there 
SP:	Yeah we 
SP:	we get along  um the one who left was still hangs out with us 
SP:	oh 
SP:	um 
SP:	Did he just  he's still at the school 

SP:	He just couldn't sleep 
	 
SP:	he just he switched um dorm buildings 
SP:	oh was he in a top bunk or some- 
SP:	he just couldn't sleep 
SP:	Yeah  the other two of us aren't cause we put we put ours down 

	 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	Which um means we have very little space in the room but we can sleep  so 
SP:	oh so he was  was he lofted 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	so 
SP:	So ours is like a lo- we have  the Hill dorms I've seen used 
SP:	hills are huge 
SP:	they're so big so the doubles are nor- like p- a- Wonderful size 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	but  ours is just like  the exact same size but with three people living in it so it  feels  way smaller  so like we have  a lofted bed  with she's all our stuff underneath and then we have our bunk bed 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	and  I was the last of the rooms so on the  top of the bunkbed 
SP:	mmm 
SP:	which kind of sucks but  it's kinda cozy up there 
	 
SP:	that works 
SP:	It just sucks cause I can't fold my laundry 
	 
SP:	oof 
	 
SP:	It's hard to do that 
SP:	Yeah  I don't  I I feel like living in Hill has a lot of benefits 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	like room size being one of them 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Like  she probably don't feel like it's that forced of a triple like there's still plenty of space in your room 
SP:	Yeah exactly like it's not like  claustrophobic by any means 
SP:	Like I can reach from  the end of my bed to the end of my  um roommates' bed 
SP:	Like  because the like 

	 
SP:	like cause the way it's set up at this point  like  it's not that far it's like three feet 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	Did you get the third bed moved out 
SP:	Not yet 
	 
SP:	Um because apparently you're supposed to pay for that 
	 
SP:	what 
SP:	I thought that was silly but  I don't know I'm still talking with res life about it 
SP:	mhm That's ridic- 
SP:	They haven't gotten back to me≈ 
SP:	≈The guy who moved out should help you out with that 
	 
SP:	Yeah  we'll figure it out  um  worst case scenario we don't move it out because we've been using his storage space 
	 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	So 
SP:	That's nice though 
SP:	not a big deal 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Worst case scenario it's nothing happens  so 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	wa- we've been living fine in the first place 
SP:	mhm It works out 
SP:	Yeah  the Hills dorms are just huge≈ 
SP:	≈I know 
SP:	like my friend's in a single there and her room's bigger than mine 
SP:	She's in a single 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	That's so nice 
	 
SP:	I wouldn't ever want to live in a single 
	 
SP:	I feel like singles  I don't know  I- at least as a freshman I definitely wouldn't want to 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	But  in some ways they're nice to just be like≈ 
SP:	≈It's nice to have the privacy  but like you lose that already key scial output 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Yes 
	 
SP:	So≈ 
SP:	≈Like I feel like it's harder to make friends maybe 
	 
SP:	Yeah little bit 
SP:	I don't know 
	 
SP:	Not a big deal 
	 
SP:	Yeah  do you like uphill or d- well you're down hill so do you eat at 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	I eat at Dewick mostly 
SP:	you like dewick 
	 
SP:	I like Dewick 
SP:	I'm sure you get Carm 
	 
SP:	I like Dewick so much better 
SP:	Dewick is better  better it's that's known 
SP:	But Carm is just like  so much more convenient 
SP:	I think we should start calling Dewick just just Mcby  just throw people off 
SP:	Change it up 
	 
SP:	I mean it wouldn't change the person is just what it is 
SP:	Yeah  that's funny 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	people would be so confused 
	 
SP:	I got people call south  um Harleston cause somebody else put money into it 
SP:	I know 
SP:	Um but most people still call it south 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Like I feel like Macphie's being left out 
SP:	Everyone knows it's south 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Poor McPhee 
	 
SP:	Poor Macphie 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	no this is it one person or is it two 
SP:	I think it's two people 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	like Dewick isn't the first name 
SP:	um 
	 
SP:	No 
SP:	It's Dewick 
SP:	I don't think Dewick's a first name 
SP:	they're both the last name 
	 
SP:	No my name is Dewick that's that'd be weird yeah 
SP:	no 
SP:	Dewick MacPhee I don't know 
	 
SP:	>I don't know what it's d- do< 
SP:	That's like there's so many Tisch buildings 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Like there's the library and then the gym 
SP:	All the Tisch family's the Tisch family's ridiculously wealthy≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	Like they own the they own the New York Giants 
	 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	So like  if they can own a sports team  they can buy buildings at all these colleges 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Like almost every major college like has a Tisch building of some kind≈ 
SP:	≈I just don't get what the purpose of that is 
	 
SP:	Like investing their money into schools 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Higher education 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I don't know  that's what their that's what they believe in 
SP:	that's Nice 
SP:	Some people believe in investing in  like more and more real estate to make more money they believe in investing in  peoples' futures 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	That's cool 
SP:	By building Nice gyms 
SP:	didn't think about it that way 
	 
SP:	The gyms 
	 
SP:	yeah 
	 
SP:	Keep the  s- Tufts students healthy 
	 
SP:	let's fight obesity  let's put a giant hill right here 
	 
SP:	That'll help 
	 
SP:	So after you work out you have to walk up hill again 
SP:	Might have killer calves 
SP:	oh yeah 
	 
SP:	That's the whole goal 
	 
SP:	ugh 
SP:	like if I had a set three goals for my entire time at Tufts  the top  three goals would all be to get killer calves 
	 
SP:	I feel like  wa- I have to every time I'm our field is down hill 
	 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	so like everyday  the walk from 
	 
SP:	Craft  to Hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	And three days a week I have French right after practice 
SP:	ooo 
	 
SP:	so either way I'm going like all the way to Olin 
	 
SP:	it's far 
SP:	and it's just miserable 
SP:	It's so far 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	especially now that it's cold  it's pretty bad 
	 
SP:	but Being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class  like you're  at the same level as the classes like I have to walk uphill to every class 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	That's true 
	 
SP:	and have  enough of a break time in between classes where I have to go back to my dorm to like  do like do work and do things 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈And then go back to class so I'm walking uphill like three or four times a day minimum 
SP:	Yeah where are most of your classes 
	 
SP:	um  probably like they're in the academic quad mostly 
SP:	Okay≈ 
SP:	≈But um  it's nice I have one class in Granoff so 
SP:	uhuh 
SP:	I don't have to walk very far for that 
SP:	That's nice  yeah mine is I've one in Granoff too and then 
	 
SP:	I have one in Eaton so that's Kinda 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	I don't know what that counts as 
	 
SP:	think it's still the academic quad 
SP:	Yeah  >and then< Olin and then psych 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	So 
	 
SP:	Not bad 
SP:	Not bad 
	 
SP:	it works out 
SP:	Yeah I feel like if I were coming from Hil  Oli- like  going to Olin and going to psych would be so easy 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	But like Eaton in  Granoff doesn't really ap-  matter 
	 
SP:	Yeah Granoff's really easy for me 
SP:	It would be the same from anywhere 
	 
SP:	yeah 
SP:	cause it's like a one minute walk from Hodge≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah  I have four classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
SP:	Really 
SP:	But then on I have no classes Wednesday  and I only have one class on Monday and Friday  so it's like a weird like I a-  pretty much always have a four day weekend 
	 
SP:	that works 
SP:	Which is nice 
	 
SP:	Yeah I set up my classes differently I have  two on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday 
	 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	And then I have one recitation on Friday 
	 
SP:	That's nice≈ 
SP:	≈um so it works out 
SP:	that's really evenly broken up 
SP:	Yeah  and I thought that would be beneficial  it's not≈ 
SP:	≈You don't like it 
SP:	it just means I have work due every day 
	 
SP:	yeah  that's what  I like about having Wednesdays off 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	cause like I don't really have to do stuff Tuesday night 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	But like I can if I wanna get ahead and then I don't have to do anything Thursday nights 
	 
SP:	That works 
SP:	Like I would do it again I think  but I also end up wasting a lot of time  cause my classes like if I don't I don't have class till six PM on Monday  
	 
SP:	so I end up just like sleeping in too late 
SP:	Really 
	 
SP:	But  you get you get you get≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah I mean I have class at nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays I hate that 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	And it's so early 
	 
SP:	I have  yeah I have I have that too 
SP:	And it's weird cause like I had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school 
SP:	I have English 
	 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	Like I thought that was early and I think this is early even though it's later≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah like getting up at eight 
SP:	I think it's 
SP:	like I get up at eight for my nine ams 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	I feel like next semster I'm gonna try and go for  everything after ten 
SP:	yeah for sure 
SP:	Especially cause now like at least  first semester I can't have any classes between  three  and  five six  three and six so like I have the that whole chunk of time likeI couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but now I'm more flexible 
SP:	that makes sense 
	 
SP:	Yeah cause of soccer sports yeah≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah but I'm still trying to have Wednesdays off  it's really nice cause it's like it breaks up the week 
SP:	it breaks up the week yeah that would be  that would be probably the most beneficial day to have off 
SP:	Yeah it's like you don't like Fridays off are nice but having one class on Fridays isn't the end of the world≈ 
SP:	≈no I have a rescitation that's not mandatory 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	and like its 
SP:	what for what class is it 
SP:	for stats 
	 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	Um  I only have to show up  if like when I pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and they tell us in advance 
SP:	mhm 
	 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	Um so that helps 
SP:	yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a week except sta- 
SP:	e- yes except for stats which has three 
SP:	Including rescitation 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	okay 
	 
SP:	But yeah  it's nice 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	One of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes 
	 
SP:	Uhhuh≈ 
SP:	≈And he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class I mean 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	and Like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	on Fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory 
SP:	oh my gosh  I'm worried for next semester cause I'm trying to take five classes 
	 
SP:	Same though 
	 
SP:	And then like  most of them like  if I take econ I'll have a rescitation≈ 
SP:	≈Okay≈ 
SP:	≈French two will have a rescitation 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	I wanna take computer science 
	 
SP:	I do too but I don't know when I want to take it≈ 
SP:	≈I know 
SP:	Like I want to take next semester but I feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it≈ 
SP:	≈I know 
SP:	I don't it want to be a super busy clas I want to be able to like learn well for that class  
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all 
SP:	>well I don't know which is which<≈ 
SP:	≈I know I need to figure it out too my one friend was like 
SP:	Rate my professor 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	work works >really well< 
	 
SP:	that is a good one 
	 
SP:	my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	That works 
SP:	So we'll see 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I don't know 
SP:	I I just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was 
	 
SP:	Yeah that's how I feel 
SP:	But 
	 
SP:	I took four pretty easy classes≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah me too 
SP:	Or classes that don't have a lot of work 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	so  ah 
SP:	Like psych is work heavy but it's like conceptually 
SP:	It;s reading heavy 
SP:	it's reading heavy 
SP:	which takes a long time but isn't that hard 
SP:	Yeah and like I feel like  my notes I'm so particular about how I take my notes that it takes even longer like≈ 
SP:	≈Do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read 
	 
SP:	So  I like have tried everything  like  oh I used to go paragraph by paragraph which I know you're not supposed to do 
SP:	mhm 
	 
SP:	but  so then like this past time for chapter eight I would read through 
	 
SP:	All of eight point one  like eight one A B C or whatever  and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like I knew  like I didn't have to re read each paragraph 
SP:	I kinda knew what was going on 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	Um but that  took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine three nine four 
SP:	Really 
	 
SP:	Like I sat in Tisch from  seven to eleven  
	 
SP:	Damn 
SP:	< doing psych > [ >] 
	 
SP:	that's that's tough 
SP:	And it's like it's such a  it's like not a waste a time but like  I could have been  >I feel like there's got to be a better way to do it < 
	 
SP:	See I don't take notes at all when I read cause I'll just get distracted by it like I'll be a so focused on the notes versus the reading 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	and I won't learn as much from it 
SP:	uh huh 
SP:	I like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built into the text book  
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	and I'll go back and do those after 
	 
SP:	Just so I really master it 
SP:	Like the the quizzes or the 

SP:	Yeah like a  flash cards and quizzes I can go back and do those 
SP:	Yeah  maybe I'll try that for chapter ten 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Like I just feel like if I get through chapter nine I'll be fine  cause ten is like the most recent thing we're learning 
SP:	yeah 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	And then I'll just be able to like  I can just review extra for it 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	for test on Thursday 
SP:	That works it's the balance that I just take like really  like  really affected notes in class 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	or I'll write down more than I necessarily 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	but just so I have it 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I feel like 
	 
SP:	My class notes could be better  but it's also like I  I feel like I  don't pay as much attention  in class because I know I have the reading to fall back on 
SP:	Okay yeah 
SP:	But like that's not good like I need to be paying attention in class but we'll see 
SP:	I get that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture I'm like  okay I I I g-  I not really getting right now just like go for further reading 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Um in the sometimes right the opposite world  like I'll read it after like a lecture  and be like uh the lecture made more sense than this this do 
SP:	this doesn't make as much sense anymore 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	so but it is what it is I got 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	It's really just studying for exams  and learning the material 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	exactly  and like the  I feel like  this exam will be a little easier to study for 
SP:	>well< not that we've seen the exam questions 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	from the first one we know how to do it 
SP:	Yes and like  it's not as much it's not as specific I feel like the material  
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	it's more theories and like vague stuff 
SP:	A little more vague 
	 
SP:	whereas like  last time we had to know like all the different functions 
SP:	yeah≈ 
SP:	≈and I was like  lots of flash cards with that one 
SP:	I spend so much time just making flashcards and then I found out they had like the flash cards built in 
SP:	I know 
SP:	And I was like really did I just spend like two days just making flashcards for no reason 
	 
SP:	That's  all my friends did the same thing and I just like  I ended up procrastinating studying for that until literally the night before  like I took super diligent notes 
SP:	which made it easier 
SP:	mhm 
	 
SP:	but  I'm not doing that this time like I need to start studying tomorrow 
	 
SP:	You know I promised myself I'd do all the reading before all the lectures this time 
	 
SP:	Uh I didn't cause I just finished chapter eight so 
SP:	Yeah  I finished chapter eight on Thursday 
	 
SP:	I finished it 
SP:	Wednesday Thursday 
SP:	Yesterday  so that was Friday 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	And chapter nine and ten are apparently really long 
	 
SP:	There's like five and six parts each 
SP:	Yeah  and like the within the individual sections like  they all scroll 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	for a really long time and I'm just like I can't do this 
	 
SP:	so much≈ 
SP:	≈Do you ever watch the videos 
	 
SP:	Yeah  um  if it seems like a short chapter 
SP:	Yeah 

File being transcribed is 2018-10-20-session-3.cha

	 
SP:	I don't  I think like if I had  talent in that aspect I would be an actor  like 
	 
SP:	I feel like my ultimate life goal would be in like a really like a well known movie franchise 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Like I don't know I feel like  a life goal for me would to  if I was an actor would be to be in the MCU or like Star Wars 
	 

SP:	Like something like I could 
SP:	Like  job security≈ 

SP:	Yeah 
SP:	like  I don't know it's they're like really recognizable people they're like very iconic but also 

SP:	you're 
SP:	like Harry potter 
SP:	Yea 

SP:	Emma Watson 
SP:	Emma Watson has done a better job breaking out 

	 
SP:	This thing≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
	 
SP:	I don't know I feel to   although to be honest  if you're like on a TV show that makes a lot of money I  I would understand why people would not want it to like  want to leave it 
	 
SP:	Yeah  yeah 
	 
SP:	Because you have to ride the train as long as it makes money 
	 

SP:	No one really knows where it came from 
SP:	I know like  thank 
	 
SP:	It's like low key shady as hell 
SP:	Yeah  but  you know as an actor you probably do need  he 

SP:	That's 
SP:	participated for the I believe I I can't believe I participated in this 
	 
SP:	Record RP Mike 
	 
SP:	But they got it do it right like state 
	 
SP:	I don't I mean I feel like 
SP:	Like the act is seriously≈ 
SP:	≈The other actors weren't even like that but though 

	 

	 
SP:	For just like we don't like how the entire truth 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Still doesn't make sense even if we have to  check 
SP:	 
	 
SP:	That's true  to be fair  like a lot of directors make like interesting choices 
SP:	Yeah  yeah 
	 
SP:	Like Michael ray explosions 
	 
SP:	That's just throwing money at the CG I had he 
	 
SP:	Every fair though  like  the explosions to get a lot of  at tention 
SP:	Yes say that because I know you like movies with lots of explosions 
SP:	 I would like it  easily or it you could like easily grab my attention  I know I I think I just like movies are like not realistic 
	 
SP:	Oh 
SP:	Like I just I like things that are not like  set too much in the real world 
SP:	mm 
SP:	like I like I don't know I like MCU because it's like  it's like in the real world but it's like not 

	 

	 
SP:	A good cheap but Frank you really wanna do Hippias 

	 _

SP:	  _

	 _

SP:	It's _

SP:	and Like  it's  if you ever wanted to know what like the  the bilabial valer like  tract of your like tongue is then like take linguistics otherwise do not _

SP:	but like it's ∇w̲ay _

	 _

SP:	mm _

SP:	than I was expecting, _

	 _

SP:	∆which if you like maybe if you went∆ to like a h̲igher like  level linguistics it'd be m- it'd be more interesting?≈ _

SP:	≈I m̲ _

SP:	probably? _

	 _

SP:	I don't kno̲ _

	 _

SP:	cause I ↑feel like more- m- _

SP:	you have to build on those, _

	 _

SP:	∆cause I feel like∆ most intro classes are ⁎like m _

SP:	yeah exactly that's why it's like really specific, _

SP:	so it's like kind of boring _

SP:	s- oh _

SP:	I-  I'd like it's if it was general I think I would enjoy it mo̲re actually, _

SP:	oh _

SP:	°no,° _

	 _

SP:	uh did I mention that I hate my life I hate my classes um  it's like  it's it's not bad  honestly I I'm doing pretty well so _

	 _

SP:	it's just all the homeworks take forever _

	 _

SP:	Yeah I heard that too _

SP:	Yeah _

	 _

SP:	Television _

SP:	As long as I make through  comp fifteen if I can't make it through then I have to like totally change everything _

SP:	Oh my god _

SP:	I don't know I don't  cause comp fifteen I'm like worried cause after that you ta- you take that  you take like one hundred level course in comp sci and then like  you don't have to take anymore for CBS _

	 _

SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	Comp sci  they were just like the  the hard  like super hard comp sci class _

SP:	Comp forty≈ _

SP:	≈Company as _

SP:	< Yeah≈ _

SP:	≈You don't _

SP:	and comp fifteen's supposed to be pretty hard so≈ _

SP:	≈Them  are you to do with the come forty two or no no _

SP:	Yeah _

	 _

SP:	That's good _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	It's good _

SP:	And if I don't if I decide to like  if I can't handle comp fifteen I could just minor and you don't need to take come fifteen _

SP:	We should _

	 _

SP:	huh _

	 _

SP:	A what moment you wanna be a CVS major _

	 _

SP:	um I mean I thought about psychology  but then like I kind of wanted to like diversify you know _

	 _

SP:	so _

	 _

SP:	Yeah basically and comp sci's like pretty interesting  I like it _

	 _

SP:	Yes for interesting _

	 _

SP:	And I'm thinking about like  pre law stuff so _

SP:	Pre law _


SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	There's in the pre law  court _

SP:	Now≈ _

SP:	≈There's like  I took um _

	 _

SP:	I mean just the perfect the the bar and everything on your own _

SP:	Yeah and the LSAT yeah  um I took sociology of law _

SP:	O _

	 _

SP:	And there's like a couple like  random law classes there's like philosophy of law _

	 _

SP:	And then like business law _

	 _

SP:	And stuff _

SP:	What a flaw _

SP:	I haven't taken  the like  apparently like  you don't really have to take law related stuff before you go to law school which is like  kinda worrisome cause like I don't know if I really like it until I go to law school and like if I go to law school and I don't like it then like what do you do _

	 _

SP:	That's true _

	 _

SP:	Yeah≈ _

SP:	≈Lawyers _

	 _

SP:	lawyers _


	 _

SP:	Or _

	 _

SP:	CBS is supposed to be a good  like pre major  if you're  or major undergraduate majors  if you're looking for law stuff _

	 _

SP:	Wait why  why is it so _

	 _

SP:	cause just like psychology and then like  you have to take logic and stuff _

	 _

SP:	Oh _

SP:	for CBS  so _

	 _

SP:	kay _

SP:	or Like house of that _

	 _

SP:	although I'm like _

	 _

SP:	Debating about like the importance cause like law school like  GPA and your LSAT score are like  the number one most important things so like  I'm not sure if I should like  switch out of CBS to like an easier major so that I can have a high GPA  cause there's like  cause the-  apparently like  law schools don't care like what's where what your what you did in undergrad as long as your  grades are high _

	 _

SP:	like there's like they they'd rather take like a four point oh in like film and media studies over like a  three point four in like engineering or something _

SP:	That's _

SP:	That's odd why is that _

SP:	cause like I mean  I think it's just like the schools like want  want the higher rankings from like their a- their average GPA is high so they get more money you know _

SP:	Why um _

SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	it's like  I'd say  I think it's like I it's nice cause it's not as like  subjective as like  choosing a undergraduate college cause like it's just like pure like  GPA and LSAT but like kinda sucks _

	 _

SP:	I feel like I should know more _

	 _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	But I don't _

	 _

SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	I like get those  I think I get those done like  mm soon ish _

SP:	mhm _

	 _

SP:	and then Chinese one and two and I thought that was it cause I took French  I'd passed out of three semesters of French so that would been six total semesters  but like apparently you have to get to at least  Chinese three before _

	 _

SP:	cause you need like  three semesters of two languages to pass out _

SP:	O≈ _

SP:	≈But then like  now I can use the Chinese cinema as my world civ  so I'm done with that _

	 _

	 _

SP:	°That's really int° so how are you allowed to do that or like  who hired you  how does that work _

SP:	                                                            Hm: _

SP:	I have a I am slightly inclined to say there _

SP:	 _

	 _

	 
SP:	like within the show 
SP:	Within the season 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	because like if I've I feel like if I focus on the whole season it's

	just it's just be too much  and like I I feel like it you can

	still allude to like other episodes 
SP:	yeah _

SP:	Yeah yeah she said you're allowed to like look at it as a whole

	and then just like focus on an episode 
SP:	Yeah yeah  so I was I was thinking of doing that 
	 
SP:	mhm 
	 
SP:	Yeah I was like debating and you have ever heard of like on my block 
	 
SP:	I heard of it≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	They casted like this like  white girl to play like 
SP:	Yeah it was like weird yeah 
SP:	a Mex- she didn't even how to speak Spanish 

	 
SP:	 and like  they're  really doing their best there 
SP:	Yeah 

SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Pick something so I could be more critical 
	 
SP:	Yeah  that's a good thing about like coven is that they touch on like  they inadvertently touch on it cause obviously cause it's like oh witches and like  that's not real but like they still touch on that divide   _

SP:	mhm 
SP:	 and it's very evident _

	 
SP:	and like  they do 
	 
SP:	>To a certain extent do a good job< 
	 
SP:	mhm 

	 
SP:	uh huh 
SP:	After the war 
SP:	After World War two a lot of Nazis fled to 
	 
SP:	Argentina 
SP:	that why they ha- that's why they have those rooted like very prejudiced  views on certain things 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Yeah which is  interesting because  like  my family went to Argentina in the late eighteen hundreds  so 
	 
SP:	Just I yeah I was talking about Argentina like certain Arg- Argentine people 
	 
SP:	oh yeah it's very like 
SP:	and like just the way they  yeah it's≈ 
SP:	≈Europeanized 
	 
SP:	Yeah and they have certain like  prejudices≈ 
SP:	≈mhm 
	 
SP:	Yeah they do 
SP:	Which is really interesting 
	 
SP:	Yeah I was reading an article how like it's gotten less prejudiced

	now after the country fell apart  cause they're like oh maybe

	we are like the rest of Latin America 
	 
SP:	maybe we're like the rest of Latin America 

SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	It is very white 
	 
SP:	right 
SP:	it is 
SP:	yeah 
SP:	Is has a very small population of like 
	 

SP:	I haven't  met an origin 
	 _

	 
SP:	diluted _


	 
SP:	Like if you look at the soccer team 
	 
SP:	mm 
	 
SP:	Obviously I do  um  like  I would say like at least a good handful of them  like look like they have indigenous roots 
	 
SP:	Oh indigenous roots≈ 
SP:	≈mhm 
SP:	um 
	 
SP:	Yeah 

	 
SP:	That 
SP:	Native 
SP:	Yeah native 
	 
SP:	native so like yeah  that makes sense 
	 
SP:	Yeah  so it's a lot like    I think like the government is super white and they perpetuate like the whiteness 
SP:	oh a one hundred percent 
SP:	So like there actually is like  a decent population of indigenous people  and like mixed people but they get like obscured by the government and are kind of like left out of it 
	 
SP:	When do the indigenous people  not get ups-  like where 
SP:	No true 
SP:	 like 
SP:	yeah  they're just like not as visible so people like perceive it as like is the super white country 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	yeah 
SP:	which like it is but also has a significant non white population that's just kind of hidden 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	Because they want to present this image as like the Europeanized Latin American country 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	that's wild 
	 
SP:	Yeah 

	 
SP:	Yep 
SP:	It's like a two way mirror but only a one way mirror  Or 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Or  all way mirror I don't know  not really mirror 
	 
SP:	Or is  mirror the reality, 
	 
SP:	question mark 
	 
SP:	Isn't it by definition a reflection of reality? 
	 
SP:	Whatever you whatever you think man 
	 
SP:	If you could see through it would  it would just be a no way mirror right,  a zero way mirror? 
	 
SP:	I guess, yeah 
	 
SP:	Or a one, 
	 
SP:	Are one way mirrors the one that you can see through? 

	 
SP:	A- from one side  but  not the other side?, 
SP:	This is an existential conversation we're having 
SP:	Yeah I feel like it probably would cause a two-way mirror would be reflective on both sides and you wouldn't be able to see much through it 
	 
SP:	astute 
	 
SP:	Astute, sir 
	 
SP:	This room is weird  I feel like I'm in a padded room 

	 
SP:	Like some nice visuals in the back 

	 
SP:	Neon green is like the third best green 

SP:	≈Muted colors like 

	 
SP:	What what's a muted what would youeven consider a muted color, 
SP:	Like 
SP:	like forest green is an acceptable green because it's not like in your face you know,  it's like a polite green that asks you how are you, and doesn't like punch you in the face like neon green does 
	 
SP:	On one hand I agree because forest green is obviously the best green 
SP:	Of course you agree because I'm always right 
	 
SP:	I- I would say it's more that forest green is just the best green 
	 
SP:	Neon green sucks 
SP:	That being said  that being said 
	 
SP:	neon green is one of the best greens but it's not the best but it's it's close 

SP:	That's true 
	 
SP:	but then some experiences are better than others  and I don't know a- the quality of this experience because I've heard that it's less of a dance and more of a concert,  and that doesn't sound very 

SP:	you wouldn't even feel ba- 
SP:	>Do you<  feel  while 
SP:	Well I mean  if you're crying out >I<  have likea 
SP:	Good an ice cold heart 
	 
SP:	Could just 
SP:	There's like a baseline of like sadness like empathy maybe but 
SP:	Well 
	 
SP:	I don't think it's 
	 
SP:	deserves so 
SP:	Empathy is very important and it's a defining factor in emotional intelligence did you know that 
	 
SP:	last night we were watching planet earth and there were these turtles 
SP:	Like I can't comprehend intuition 
SP:	What do you mean 

SP:	Like 
SP:	in general 
	 
SP:	Yeah because like 
SP:	It's like a sixth sense it's just a feeling you get 
SP:	Yeah but where does that come from 
SP:	Lives you know 
	 
SP:	How how does like a 
SP:	I think we I feel like we develop it because we learn a lot about social interactions and we kind of pick um 
SP:	Yeah but how do like baby turtles know to  go towards the light 
	 
SP:	Well they're biologically programmed I would think there's certain cells in t he brain 
SP:	But what is the biological programming like this is where I'm confu sed 
SP:	What we come we're kind of talking about that in psych nine a little b it like the brain like brain plasticity and how like the brain adapts to certain situations I guess 
SP:	the one lost 
	 
SP:	throughout the evolution 
SP:	But 
SP:	but it's saying that it can become like pre that they can come for it out did 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	That's crazy 
SP:	A lot of animal do that we're  some of the only 
	 
SP:	So should not be like evidence for like physical 
SP:	Like 
	 
SP:	Like there's a physical 
	 
SP:	Part of like memory 
	 
SP:	Yeah yeah  the brain is constantly like reconfiguring itself throughout the evolution of the species like I feel like we're the only  ones that have to develop like after were born like a lot of animals just  come pre programm ed already  but some 
	 
SP:	Yeah but I feel like I like all animals word 
SP:	Thanks 
	 
SP:	I don't think learning is outside of the room 
SP:	No no they demonstrate learning but I feel like we are the only ones t hat are  were born the most help  I mean if you think about it like   a baby  zebra or something will start walking within like  a day to  and we're like  just  vegetated dental work 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Two and a half so 
SP:	I guess I guess animals are like 
	 
SP:	Protected by their mothers are much more hopeless 
	 
SP:	general I I guess I w ould agree with that 
SP:	yeah that's true where were very spoiled species 
	 
SP:	Because like animals  like out I was just thinking like  if you're  born alone you how to out of your eco alone  you just know 
	 
SP:	But you need to go towards the water not in the full moon and stuff like that like 
SP:	Yeah that's true 
SP:	Although some animals were demonstrated to sh demonstrate uhm they show altruism so like if their  kid is in some kind of danger they will sacrifice themse lves  finals do that 
SP:	Yeah I feel like altruism is like a pretty  explainable 
	 
SP:	thing 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Are I'm like 
SP:	like an imprinting and stuff like that≈ 
SP:	≈yeah  >definitely I don't<  like I must not fully understand the like 
	 
SP:	The  controversy around uhm 
	 
SP:	Whatever just talking about which I have forgotten 
	 
SP:	Intuition altruism imprinting 
SP:	Altruism 

SP:	altruism 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	I feel like  I don't understand the controversy around alters my feel like it's pretty explainable like  flick fitness Street 
	 
SP:	I guess yeah I mean  I don't know it's kind of like if you are on the team of survival of the fittest then  it's kinda strange that a fit mother would for example  sacrifice herself to protect her sickly child like that seems kind of counter intuitive but then 
SP:	I think sickly it might be a defining characteristic which would  make altruism not really as important 
	 
SP:	I I think I feel like altruism makes sense a lot if you View the goal as passing on your genes 
SP:	Why what do you mean 

	 
SP:	if your kids are like 
SP:	Meaning if the kids are healthy and they're being in 

SP:	If you're yeah so it's in your best interest to keep your it's much easier to keep a kid healthy than it is to literally become pregnant and then like  have the kid again 
SP:	okay 
SP:	Gotcha 
	 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	So it's like within your it's in your best interest to keep alive I feel like I 
SP:	I'll give to 
	 
SP:	That's true that makes sense 
	 
SP:	I don't know maybe it's too like utilitarian 
SP:	Like it to 
	 
SP:	Where to look at it  I don't know 
	 
SP:	At the end  world is brutal I mean there's no democracy over there it's just like you sick by 
	 
SP:	Right≈ 
SP:	≈see ya 
	 
SP:	Yeah like that's 
SP:	So  no health care for the animals 
SP:	It 
SP:	it's so human to like  project and like after more five s tuff≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah for sure 
SP:	And just like 
	 
SP:	give it like No personify things but 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	In reality like  things don't care there's no mercy is no empathy like 
SP:	Nope 
SP:	My role I mean  I we were learning a lot about that and psych twenty last s emester about uhm self reference insult generation and things like you're more l ikely to remember things anymore like a to understand things if you do them your self and you somehow 

SP:	Oh d-did you do like programming before 

SP:	I've had enough 
	 
SP:	Yeah I had like a little like 

SP:	Just personal experience like I was bored just screwing around and um 
SP:	Oh c- 
SP:	Oh y- oh you just 
	 
SP:	Taught myself a little bit 
SP:	born knowing comp- comp sci oh 
SP:	whatever 
SP:	Nice 
SP:	No it's not it's not intuitive 
SP:	that's cool 
	 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	it's definitely not intuitive   but um  yeah 
SP:	mhm 
	 
SP:	Yeah I am still have yet to do all that come stuff and it's makes me quite nervo us because I don't I have no experience 
	 
SP:	Yeah when you're gonna 
SP:	At all 
	 
SP:	I mean 
SP:	I wouldn't declare a comp sci minor or anything like that until you've done comp 
SP:	Although I- I d- I do know some comes I jokes like Hey you're boolean me  so mean 
SP:	boolean 

	 
SP:	False 
	 
SP:	Equals equals 
SP:	Or true≈ 
SP:	≈Equals equals true because  you're mean to me 

SP:	Equals equals 
SP:	Yeah there's like  I remember the equals equals  there's equals- equals equals and then like 
	 
SP:	Not equal to which is exclamation point a cool  this is all is just a lot l ike  I don't know it's all syntax 
SP:	You're just scaring me now 
SP:	I really don't like language 
SP:	I love language  I love languages but I hate late learning it 
SP:	Like actual language but not 
SP:	like I does don't at all want to be involved in learning them  I just think they're cool u p like 
SP:	that too 
SP:	Well language are you taking for your credits 
SP:	I took Latin three semesters 
SP:	Oh that's really cool 
SP:	It was like  six does is like a fifteen person class wit h like a super like the best professor 
SP:	>Do you like it< 
SP:	Can you like create a new Harry potter spellers 
	 
SP:	No but like it's actually pretty sick like being able to read 
SP:	That's really cool 
SP:	Um 
	 
SP:	like I'm  I did a what I did very little of the translati on homework but like  some kids I know like are actually fluent in Latin it 's crazy 
SP:	Supposed to do your homework Sir  it's not very studious 
	 
SP:	>It wasn't created< 
	 
SP:	So  no interactive 
	 
SP:	Yeah I still have to take my friend culture class  it'll be done  they almost my credits from high school 
	 
SP:	Lucky 
SP:	I really should a taken that Russian placement exam that would probabl y make things easier for pre 
SP:	If you would  well you can  in order place out of language yo u can do to languages to twelve like a three class level 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	or you could do o ne language to like  anywhere from three to six and then like culture class and stuff 
SP:	Gotcha≈ 
SP:	≈But if you'd place into like  Russian for  and  French for you woul d have been completed on with your requirement 
SP:	Yeah I mean the thing is like  I  am aware of the fact that m ost might Russian is very casual and conversational and I can read and all that but  actual like writing compositions that are formal and  whatever I I don't have the schools but that's I feel like I would probably struggle in hig h level Russian because because you have to do everything I can just 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	You know make jokes whatever like 
	 
SP:	We could take like Russian three though and then just do one year rush one semester of Russian be done but whatever 
SP:	Interact 
	 
SP:	It's too late 
	 
SP:	Yeah I mean it's fine I I plot practicing of Russian with my family and all that so 
SP:	mhm 
	 
SP:	I'll just 
SP:	A friend 
SP:	What about French culture≈ 
SP:	≈One of the kids must read from Honduras  and like  it's funny because even though Honduras obviously the Spanish speaking  country  like primarily he uhm  up like pro he went by private schools are taught English 
SP:	hm 
SP:	um so English is like  like really his best like which is first l anguage  um  and Spanish you very conversational but he's like  it's funny because we have like four five kids to take Spanish in the suite  and they all like column out so often on my grammar and like 
SP:	hm 
SP:	So funny 
SP:	Spelling mistakes and stuff 
	 
SP:	Things about learning a language uhm like as a  just in your family or whate ver it's really interesting because conversation only  you are much more li kely to have an interesting conversation with someone than people who learn it formally like I  have that experience with French like when I talk to people who knew French slang and things like that like it's  almost a separate thing in of itself to know all the slang and I feel like  it's just  it's not as interesting like verses writing at somebody who only has an oral education writing is  like  impossible but then people were formally educated can't write mess 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	so I don't know 
	 
SP:	What else whatever's more useful you know 
SP:	Yeah but like 
SP:	I feel like it's more of a  function of like if you learn it  conversational you learn vocab and then you learn grammar 
	 
SP:	I yeah 
SP:	Like you learn those the same time and 
SP:	Grammar becomes kind of intuitive almost because it's like t rial and error 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	you can just pick up on it yeah 
SP:	yeah yeah yeah 
SP:	but when you learn to formally there's no like actual practicing the way that like 
SP:	Um 
SP:	At least in my fears was no actual practice so without like  immersion  is practice and  as such like vocab kinda just  is fleeting like you learn it for months  to  get pass a tough many move on 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	It's yeah it's so much easier to learn it kind of on the way I think   languages are more  like gradual that way I feel like learning them formally  it's almost Counterproductive 
SP:	it sucks I hate languages≈ 
SP:	≈yeah 
SP:	a healing which is  the only time I would ever  like I would be down to learn another language but I would only do it for merch ant 
	 
SP:	Russian 
SP:	>I wouldn't do it<≈ 
SP:	≈Russian learn Russian 
SP:	I'm not learning Russian 
SP:	I'll help 
SP:	Russian doesn't have the same alpha does it 
SP:	come on 
	 
SP:	Notes are like 
SP:	Yeah I'm not doing that  that's so much work 
SP:	no come on≈ 

SP:	≈hi yeah that's how I say hi at fluid 
SP:	that's not 
SP:	That's not how Russian works at the hazy hydration 
SP:	Okay I can say in English so 
SP:	No 
	 
SP:	Russian is a great language≈ 
SP:	≈English  is the best language 
SP:	you peasant 
	 
SP:	Cuz I speak English the best language 
SP:	You  you hasn't English is not the best language≈ 

SP:	 and like hit me in the door _

SP:	that would've been t- that would've been _

	 _

SP:	Oh yeah _

SP:	because they have lakes and rivers no one else has water _

	 _

SP:	Um and then Houston is fun  cause this big city≈ _

SP:	mhm _

	 _

SP:	mhm≈ _

SP:	≈and then San Antonio  cause they have the river walk _

SP:	Anyway  um _

	 _

SP:	What else _

	 _

SP:	It's just so awkward to start a conversation from like nowhere _

SP:	Yeah  make up one  how about this if you could go anywhere in the world where would you go _

	 _

SP:	that's such an ice breaker question _

	 _

SP:	Anywhere in the world I will _

	 _

SP:	Like for me I wanna live in um Sweden _

SP:	Oh cool  have you ever been _

SP:	Now _

SP:	me neither _

SP:	but it looks like a cool place to go _

SP:	no _

SP:	Yeah  like I haven't been to like the northern European region _

	 _

SP:	Well if  if English still counts as part of  the Europe union then  I have _

	 _

SP:	But I'm not sure  if it's still counts right now _

SP:	mm That's fair _

	 _

SP:	um How could I decide _


SP:	                How did you decide that _

SP:	Oh  um it's just _

	 _

SP:	Culture why isn't  probably  cause um  I used to study a little bit of art  so _

	 _

SP:	um I guess the environment there kind of attracts _

SP:	                                                mmm _

SP:	                     >Oh human factors engineer<≈ _

SP:	≈okay _

	 _

SP:	Kind of small program _

SP:	oh that's cool _

	 _

SP:	yeah Like in my um  pre at  pre major advisor session we only have like  seven people _

	 _

SP:	in _

SP:	Really _

SP:	    In human factors engineering  and others  including me there are only two that are major  in human factors _

SP:	                                                                                                                            Really  that's so small _

SP:	Yeah  but um on the graduating class was like forty students last year  so I'm not worried  people just might just switch in _

SP:	                                                                                                                                Switch back in yeah _

SP:	I know a lot of people right now that are trying to switch into engineering _

	 _

SP:	Oh really _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	   >I was thinking about switching to arts and science<≈ _

SP:	≈Really  yeah I feel like once people get here  they decide that they don't want to  necessarily do what they've signed up for _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	   But yeah I have a lot of friends that  came here as arts and sciences got here and then decided they wanted to do engineering≈ _

SP:	≈mm _

	 _

SP:	Fair enough the reason why I want to switch to art and sciences is like I don't  I don't like computer science _

	 _

SP:	mm _

SP:	 I've heard comp  fifteen is pretty hard _

SP:	                                            Yeah I heard that too _

	 _

SP:	So but I have to take that cause that's  kinda the requirements for  engineering school I'm not sure but I have to take comp eleven  so _

	 _

SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	And  that is not my thing  my plan is to take no computer science classes _

SP:	What's your major _

SP:	I wanna do either bio or bio psych _

SP:	mhm _

SP:	  and pre med _

	 _

SP:	pre-med _

	 _

SP:	So lots and lots of science labs _

SP:	                               mm _

	 _

SP:	Are you taking physics this semester≈ _

	 _

SP:	I heard comments like  like  I heard chem only has like eight thirty sessions like _

SP:	There's an eight thirty which is the one that I'm in and there's a one thirty  but I have practice during the one thirty so I'm in the eight thirty _

	 _

SP:	My f- my uh roommate he's actually doing chem next semester  and the only time slot available form him is the eight thirty one _

SP:	≈Yeah  I don't know it's good because then you get chem out of the way _

	 _

SP:	That's true that's true _

SP:	                   And then you can enjoy the rest of your day _

SP:	                         that's true _

SP:	cause you don't have to think about going to chemistry _

SP:	Yeah  I have math this semester eight thirty to  nine twenty something for like three days _

	 _

SP:	Love a good eight thirty class  I have  eight thirties on Monday≈ _

SP:	≈mhm _

SP:	   and Wednesday  and then the rest is nine thirties _

SP:	that's nice  yeah my schedule this semester is kinda nice with Thursdays and Fridays cause I basically  like my classes finish on thursday and Fridays  in the morning so like  eight thirty to nine thirty and then like another  ten thirty to eleven forty five _

SP:	mm≈ _

SP:	≈to like n-  and like no classes in the afternoon _

SP:	so _

SP:	well that's good _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	I feel like the worst would be to have a whole bunch of classes on Friday _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  no rest  my goal for next semester is to have like three and three and a half days a weekend _

	 _

SP:	ew _

SP:	wow _

SP:	So like basically I can  sleep my whole entire morning and then grab lunch and then go back probably go back to sleep again  and then go to class≈ _

SP:	≈That sounds so nice  my schedule  for next semester I  am trying to make it well I have to plan practice into my schedule _

SP:	mhm _

SP:	 and my practice is from one thirty to six on Tuesdays through Fridays  yeah  it's a long time _

	 _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	 So basically you don't have any free time in the afternoon _

SP:	                                                            Basically yeah  and so I have mostly morning classes  but the way that I have it set up  which I hope works out I only have one class on Friday and it's a chem recitation which isn't mandatory _

SP:	mhm _

	 _

SP:	and then I only have  one class on Wednesdays also _

	 _

SP:	mm≈ _

SP:	≈but then I have two six thirty classes like six thirty PM  Monday I have a six thirty lab  and Thursday I have a six thirty class  but it's fine _

	 _

SP:	How many classes are youo taking um next semester≈ _

SP:	≈Four _

	 _

SP:	Including the practice _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  I have chem  English two  French four  and abnormal psych _

	 _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	I I feel like  the practice It's kinda hard _

SP:	Yeah it's a lot _

SP:	I _

SP:	I can never do like  four to five or even three hours of might be three hours but not four hours of practice on a certain sports _

	 _

SP:	It's nice though because  like  since  our team has seventy people _

	 _

SP:	which is  huge compared to most sports _

SP:	Oh wow _

	 _

SP:	Yeah yeah _

	 _

SP:	uh so  they don't really notice slash care  if you're not there everyday _

	 _

SP:	mm≈ _

SP:	≈and also like there's two different times you can come at one thirty or you can come at three  and then  uh Mondays we have no practice and Wednesdays a lot of people don't go  because they can't  so like this semester I went I went Tuesday Thursday Friday because I have class on Wednesdays _

SP:	mm _

SP:	and  so it just works _

	 _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	  Gotcha _

	 _

SP:	How far is it from here _

	 _

SP:	It's just like the course load  right now  I I just finished my mid term last week≈ _

SP:	≈Oh _

SP:	  so I'm so I'm just planning to pick up my basketball _

SP:	                     Yeah _

	 _

SP:	Hopefully  there's gonna be no exams close by I know there's a psych paper right _

SP:	Yeah the papers due next week _

SP:	  On November the fifteenth _

	 _

SP:	But it's a short paper _

SP:	yeah _

SP:	   It's like a _

SP:	so like six hundred words _

SP:	                        yeah  and like a mini summary of what you read _

SP:	mm _

SP:	which is  that's easy _

	 _

SP:	I asked professor summers about like what kind of articles he's looking for  because like I was kind of confused if he's only _

	 _

SP:	Wanting us to find  news articles or  news  plus psychology analysis≈ _

SP:	≈Yeah _

	 _

SP:	so so _

SP:	   What did he say≈ _

SP:	≈He he said on just anything  anything would  anything just  related to psychology it's fine _

	 _

SP:	I don't know≈ _

SP:	≈Yeah I need to find an article  I was talking to someone yesterday who said she's doing hers on PTSD≈ _

SP:	≈oh PTSD that's nice≈ _

SP:	≈That's a  that's a good one I feel like _

SP:	                                     I think I'm doing gender roles _

SP:	Oh that's also good _

	 _

SP:	Because like I'm not that into biological psychology  it's just too hard for me _

	 _

SP:	I prefer social psych _

SP:	Same _

SP:	I'm really excited about this next unit  because we're doing  social psych and uh _

	 _

SP:	Media _

SP:	    Disorders _

SP:	             oh  disorders _


SP:	Yeah which I think are the  the cool parts _

SP:	                                            mm I feel like it's so cool to like  an  analyze behaviors≈ _

SP:	≈Yeah _

	 _

SP:	Um back in my high school I still I used to take  um advanced econ but this class  is considered  consisted off like multiple areas  one part of the class we actually learn behavioral psych  so that' really really cool _

SP:	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Really _

SP:	I  I really like that _

SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	So that's pretty nice _

	 _

SP:	Yeah that's why I wanna do abnormal psych≈ _

SP:	≈mhm _

SP:	  because that class is about like different disorders _

	 _

SP:	You learn about disorders  which I think is the cool psych stuff≈ _

SP:	≈I like everything else _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	I just feel like it's more fun to  to learn about what people do and don't do  and also  now that I've been in this class sometimes I see people and start thinking about what they're doing≈ _

SP:	≈mm _

	 _

SP:	like I am part of junior jumbo's _

SP:	       mm _

SP:	do you know what that is _

	 _

SP:	Okay it's this club  where you go to a preschool once a week for two hours and you have a little buddy  and you play with them  little kid my buddies three _

	 _

SP:	three years old≈ _


SP:	≈Yeah _

	 _

SP:	And  I went last week after we had learned about attachment styles _

SP:	        pretty cute _

	 _

SP:	and then I was like man  I'm watching it applied in real life _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  how long is the program like for the club thing _

	 _

SP:	It's the whole year _

SP:	That okay _

	 _

SP:	do you gotta pick the same one next year as well  >if you are deciding to<  keep doing this club _

	 _

SP:	Pick the same what _


	 _

SP:	Like the same kid _

	 _

SP:	No _

	 _

SP:	So like basically one kid per year≈ _

SP:	≈Yeah except that someone I talked to  said that  oh it was a teacher  that works in the preschool now that used to  do the club  she had one buddy for two years in a row _

SP:	mm _

SP:	 and then a third different one so I guess it just depends _

	 _

SP:	Because _

SP:	cause I  feel like I feel like it's gonna be so um _

	 _

SP:	So cool I guess to  keep in touch with the same person for like consecutive years _

SP:	                                                                           All of it yeah _

SP:	Yeah to see  what's happening around him or her _

	 _

SP:	I feel like it depends on what age you get when you start off _

	 _

SP:	mhm _

SP:	because since it's a preschool they get too old to be there _

SP:	mm _

SP:	 I think the oldest you can be there is five≈ _

SP:	≈mm _

	 _

SP:	so in theory I could have my buddy for two years  like this year  and the next year≈ _

SP:	≈mhm _

	 _

SP:	I don't know though _

	 _

SP:	My  I don't have one I only work in the summer _

	 _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	Wait does tufts _

SP:	To use _

	 _

	 _

SP:	mhm _

	 _

	 _

SP:	>Eventually< _

SP:	  In my junior year or my my  senior year I'm not sure  cause the thing it's  it's not only the culture  but also  the um  my field in German so popular _

	 _

SP:	like industrial design wise _

SP:	oh _

SP:	German has probably the best industrial design programs in the world _

SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	Also Britain  but uh _

	 _

SP:	You already speak English you're good _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	>I'm trying to learn German< _

	 _

SP:	yeah that's cool _

SP:	     At at least I'll  yeah because if I'm  going to study abroad I have to be like in German four _

	 _

SP:	So that you can actually converse with people _

SP:	                                            Right _

	 _

SP:	I take French _

	 _

SP:	mhm _

	 _

SP:	And I wanna go to France this summer  the tufts and how are  maybe we'll see  um  but yeah  I don't know I've I've been taking French for so long  that when I got here I was like well I feel like I have to continue so that I can actually learn how to speak it  because  French programs in Texas are not very good  so even though I took French for like five years _

SP:	mhm _

SP:	I learned the exact same thing every year _

	 _

SP:	which is nothing _

SP:	 hm _

	 _

SP:	which isn't super helpful when you're trying to talk to people _

	 _

SP:	True _

	 _

SP:	Are you still learn like two years I'm in actually one year of German back in my high school but that didn't help because  we only have  two classes per week  ands sometimes the teacher would not be there so basically have self studies _

	 _

SP:	You only had class two days a week _


	 _

SP:	No I'm in two days for German _

SP:	      For  for German _

SP:	                         yeah _

	 _

SP:	Back at my high school _

SP:	so that's not good because _

SP:	Wow _

SP:	Yeah _

	 _

SP:	Once I learn something on Monday I'll basically forgot on Friday _

SP:	                                                          Yeah _

SP:	                                                             and over the weekend I have no incentive to review German then back to Monday I basically forgot everything again _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  that's rough _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	So I basically didn't learn anything from my high school  still start in college _

	 _

SP:	You're you're starting over _

SP:	  I guess _

SP:	Yeah _

	 _

SP:	That's okay German seems hard I have a friend that's in Geone he seems like he's struggling a little bit _

	 _

SP:	mm _

SP:	he said it's easy but also  hard at the same time _

SP:	                                     who is his it was his name _

SP:	Cole _

SP:	Cole _


	 _

SP:	Yeah he's not in my section _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  so yeah Germans pretty fun  um _

	 _

SP:	Yeah _

	 _

SP:	So are you gonna do did you test out of any of the language requirement _

	 _

SP:	um I  placed out of English cause I took AP English back in my high school  um except for that one no _

	 _

SP:	But I placed out of some like some physics and chemistry things≈ _

SP:	≈so that that that kind of helps _

SP:	Oh cool _

	 _

SP:	>That that that actually really helps<  saves my time next semester so that so that I don't have to wake up at eight thirty _

	 _

SP:	I  got credit for  calc _

	 _

SP:	oh calc BC _


	 _

SP:	AB≈ _

SP:	≈mhm≈ _

SP:	≈so I have to take only one other math  and then for English  I tested out of half of the English credit _

	 _

SP:	so I have to take English two _

SP:	  mm _

	 _

SP:	and then for language I placed out of French two and th- one and two _

	 _

SP:	So you're starting in French three _

SP:	so I'm in th- _

SP:	yeah _

	 _

SP:	That's really nice I think _

	 _

SP:	Yeah so I'm gonna do three and then I'm doing four next semester  and then if I go to France over the summer I'll do five there _

	 _

SP:	mm≈ _

SP:	≈And then six when I come back _

	 _

SP:	it's nice I don't th _

	 _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	Yeah for me I'm  yeah I'm planning to do like German one two three four for my  sophomore and freshman year _

	 _

SP:	And then are you gonna do _

	 _

SP:	Study abroad _

SP:	hmm _

SP:	probably _

	 _

SP:	If I have that time _

	 _

SP:	I really want to _

	 _

SP:	yeah I feel like study abroad would be so fun _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	would you go for a year or would you go for a semester _

	 _

SP:	I'll probably go for one semester≈ _

SP:	≈Yeah me too  I feel like it's just  it just makes more sense to only go for a semester _

	 _

SP:	because then that way  like you don't fall behind _

	 _

SP:	Right≈ _

SP:	≈In anything _

	 _

SP:	mhm _

	 _

SP:	Yeah I don't miss my family  And my friends here so _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  yeah because if you  but also the good thing about if you go abroad junior year is like most people are also going abroad junior year _

	 _

SP:	mm _

SP:	 So like you and your friends might be gone at the same time  so then you come back _

SP:	                                                                            True _

	 _

SP:	And it's not like  like it wouldn't be fun if  your friend went abroad like sophomore year and then you go junior year _

	 _

SP:	Yeah _

SP:	And then you're like friends only for freshman and senior year _

	 _

SP:	mm _

	 _

SP:	True _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  and another thing I'm kind of worry about studying abroad it's like _

	 _

SP:	uh a definitely language problems  cause  although I might study one two three four That doesn't mean like it's gonna help me in the daily conversations _

SP:	                                                                                              Yeah _

	 _

SP:	Yeah  yeah _

SP:	Still  so  is the same thing cause we we took English classes back in China  but those classes  don't necessarily prepare you for  English conversations _

SP:	                                                                                                                                                                                Yeah that's fair _

SP:	like _

SP:	Yeah so like it's only  test prep _

SP:	                       It's different≈ _

SP:	≈yeah _

SP:	 yeah _

	 _

SP:	But the good thing also about studying abroad is that  like once you get there  by the time you leave you're gonna be so good at conversation _

	 _

SP:	mm _

SP:	cause you'll only be speaking for the most part in that language  for  a good chunk of your time for an entire semester _

SP:	mm _

SP:	and then they were this and they like changed into swat gear left as the swat team 
SP:	Uh huh 
SP:	Um  or they came in as the s- no they  they came in right 
	 
SP:	they c- 
SP:	Because they came in  um  when the  like alarm went off they came in  as 
SP:	The they they came in for the nine one one call 
	 
SP:	Yeah  and then but like it was just them dressed up in swat gear and so they came they took the bags money and then when they were leaving as the swat they just brought with them 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Um but and then the whole time they just kind of played  a v- a videotape of them 
	 
SP:	Mhm 
	 
SP:	Uhm 
	 
SP:	And 
	 
SP:	So yeah I just remember that being 
	 
SP:	Pretty ridiculous 
SP:	yeah it was a good movie 
	 
SP:	You know they're making a  another one 
	 
SP:	Are they 
	 
SP:	Not it's not a it's like a 
SP:	Oh it's girls though right 
SP:	Yeah it's it's um 
SP:	What's it called 
	 
SP:	It's what's his names sister 
	 
SP:	Danny's sister 
SP:	It's d anny's sister 

	 
SP:	Um 
	 
SP:	And so yeah there may and they're making another one with uh 
	 
SP:	That's pretty cool 
SP:	with her and it's like a female crew which is gonna be pretty dope I think≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah no that'll be so g- is it the same director 
	 
SP:	I don't know 
	 
SP:	I feel like it probably is≈ 
SP:	≈I don't I- 
SP:	there's probably some type of like 
	 
SP:	Um 
SP:	Runs in the family 
SP:	Yeah that's classic that's gonna be good actually 
SP:	Yeah I think so too  I want to see that 
	 
SP:	I do I'd love to see like some of the original characters make an appearance though 
	 
SP:	I'd I'd  would be  shocked if Danny wasn't in it 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	They like I think they purposely held him out of the trailer too 
SP:	You think 
SP:	think so 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Just like so he makes a surprise appearance 
	 
SP:	yeah I could see that 
	 
SP:	that actually would make a lot of sense 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	I think  yeah 
	 
SP:	I wanna see    
	 
SP:	have you ever seen the Italian job 
	 
SP:	no what's that 
	 
SP:	That's  really you haven't≈ 
SP:	≈No 
SP:	alright we're watching a movie soon≈ 
SP:	≈Really 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈what's it  what's it abuot 
SP:	It's  kind of an ocean eleven Ask 
SP:	dude those like my favorite types of movies 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	honestly they're so they're so much fun to watch 
	 
SP:	Yeah that's 
	 
SP:	Also one of  another really good heist movies 
	 
SP:	The Italian Job I don't think I've seen it 
	 
SP:	Really 
SP:	Is it like when they come out 
	 
SP:	It's it's pretty old 
SP:	Okay yeah 
SP:	It's yeah  probably older than ocean's eleven 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Um  alright we're watching that so that's dope 
SP:	that's good yeah 
	 
SP:	um 
	 

SP:	I I wanna sea  this is i- 
	 
SP:	it was called downsizing?  it's like it's like a new mo̲ 
	 
SP:	mm 
	 
SP:	all these people who were like saving up like their savings for their whole lives 
	 
SP:	yeah  downsizing 
SP:	downsizing? yeah exactly and like they  they got their offer to shrink d̲ 
	 
SP:	because it's l̲ 
SP:	ho 
SP:	b- because when you're smaller like to build a house? it's just like, 
SP:	yeah, 
	 
SP:	inexpensive=like you you just like  don't ha- like ∆you know I mean,∆  like a huge house̲ 
	 
SP:	yeah? 
	 
SP:	so it's like that might cost like a hundred dollars̲ 
	 
SP:	you know what I'm saying? 
	 
SP:	no not at all, 
	 
SP:	okay so it's kind of like, 
	 
SP:	oh ah ah wait this is a g- this is a good way to think about it 
SP:	is this like an alternate wor↑ld? 
SP:	no it's like,  no it's like this company has figured out how to like shrink people d̲≈ 
SP:	≈oh sh- like p̲h̲y̲sically shrink≈ 

SP:	≈yeah≈ 
SP:	≈oh so it's like l 
SP:	oh yeah 
SP:	I thought you meant like getting fired≈ 
SP:	≈oh 
	 

SP:	No like they're like literally live with their just like smaller 
SP:	Oh they're small okay 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	And therefore like their money buys more 
SP:	More  yeah 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	That's so that's that's interesting actually 
SP:	No it it that souonded really that the trailer was good too 
	 
SP:	They're smaller so they don't yeah they don't need as much food they need a smaller house 
SP:	Exactly yeah 
	 
SP:	Um 
	 
SP:	No yeah I think the one example they use in the trailer was like 
	 
SP:	They bought like a bottle of champagne and it lasted them like five years or something because they were just so big and they're not that big 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Which is kind of funny 
	 
SP:	Get drunk of a little sip 
	 
SP:	This is a new movie 
	 
SP:	Came out like I don't know 
SP:	Oh it came out 
	 
SP:	Maybe like a month ago 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I thought over winter break I wanna go see and never did 
	 
SP:	Been there 
	 
SP:	Yeah du- I  I think movies are so weird now it's like  s many people don't go  but like I was talking to like 
SP:	Yeah I know I just watch them on Netflix 
SP:	Yeah  people just watch them but like I was talking to 
	 
SP:	talking to my dad about this actually there's like this new company that like 
SP:	uh huh 
	 
SP:	you pay like  to get ten dollars subscription or something  and you can go to a- you can go to uh  like unlimited movies per month 
	 
SP:	At participating theatres 
SP:	Interesting 
	 
SP:	Which is like kind of crazy  cause like one movie ticket 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Is probably like ten Bucks 
	 
SP:	You pay ten dollars a month 

	 
SP:	Yeah  it's why it's insane 
SP:	They just hope 
	 
SP:	I don't really understand either 
SP:	I don't understand that model 
	 
SP:	How I don't get how they make money 
SP:	Yeah I know 
SP:	doesn't make any sense 
	 
SP:	do like  unless they have like agreements with the 
	 
SP:	Um 
	 
SP:	Like I can see how that might work like in bulk 
	 
SP:	well yeah if you have enough people doing it yeah but 
	 
SP:	If you 
	 
SP:	Like maybe if they had agreements with  like each of the individual movie theaters like  they get some kind of a  cause like the people are gonna go and probably buy snacks and stuff to  they're getting the movies for free 
SP:	Oh true  oh and you know it's like  maybe it's also like I have it  like I have the subscription and I want to go to the movie 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	but maybe like my girlfriend doesn't or like my friend doesn't so when we go like they still have to pay 
	 
SP:	Yeah  or like you get 
	 
SP:	>But if you got like a<  like they give you like a card you like show it every time you go in and they like keep track of how many people  are  um  and like the movie theater keeps track of like each  everyone who shows like the card  what this  like that says you have this subscription and then um≈ 
SP:	≈yeah 
	 
SP:	And then basically you get 
	 
SP:	A little  like  I guess  commission off each person  who uses I don't know≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
	 
SP:	I don't know  I just thought it was interesting 
	 
SP:	Because it's like 
SP:	Yeah I know that 
	 
SP:	And they're trying to get people to go to movies again 
	 
SP:	People are lazy though 
	 
SP:	I know I still don't think I would go that often 
SP:	No like  like I would say like 
	 
SP:	I think for it it's like a really good like  date thing it's like autumn it like 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Right the Somerville movie theater in Davis 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	That's like That's perfect 
SP:	I gonna use it I wanna go there at some point 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	But like  I've been here like  you know probably five months and like I I have yet to go there 
SP:	no yeah   Same 
SP:	And like I've bo- you know if 
	 
SP:	We had there was a lot but 
	 
SP:	I mean a really go see a movie 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Maybe maybe they'll be showing the Italian Job and we can go 
SP:	That's not 
SP:	er I don't know I doubt it 
	 
SP:	yeah probably 
SP:	They show like old French films 
	 
SP:	This is French 
	 
SP:	What 

	 
SP:	It's it's French 
SP:	No  I said  doesn't  the Somerville theatre show like well they show like the new  they show like some new ones and then just like old  foreign ones 
	 
SP:	Yeah I thought it was like a combination yeah≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah  I'd g-  they're showing the post there I kinda wanna go see that 
SP:	The poster 

SP:	The post 
SP:	What's that 

	 
SP:	Um it's about it's all about the um 
SP:	New or old 
	 
SP:	It's a new movie it's like a academy award nominee 
SP:	Oh wow 
SP:	Um it's  all about the 
	 
SP:	Which league was it um 
	 
SP:	Like either the Washington papers or 
	 
SP:	Oh I saw this is Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks 
SP:	um 
SP:	Yes 
SP:	Yes I really wanted to see that 
SP:	I get 
SP:	That looked really good 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I would totally go see that with you≈ 
SP:	≈that's dope 
SP:	Well I forget what it was about though is about yeah it was about the Washington post 
SP:	I yeah I don't know too much about it 
SP:	It was like a s-  something about a story they wrote or something 
SP:	Well I think  the I think they both work  er at least Tom Hanks works for the newspaper  that like  published the information  that they got 
	 
SP:	mm 
SP:	er the got leaked um and so I think it was all about like handling it how to deal with that 
SP:	Mhm 
	 
SP:	um  but I'm not  again not too sure 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	How a how are your classes going this semester so far 
SP:	 
SP:	Yeah the check≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
	 
SP:	um 
	 
SP:	what you in psych 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈How's it  how  do you like know other people in your class 
	 
SP:	Yeah I um  there's a kid in my German class who's also in psych me so we just walk straight there f- um from German 
SP:	It's good 
SP:	and then 
SP:	The German ten thirty 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
	 

SP:	um 
	 
SP:	our c- Like 
SP:	You have   right 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Yeah same 

	 
SP:	like  Cabot is like way too big for us 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	it's like 
SP:	okay same 
	 
SP:	On I can I can't think we have more than like 
	 
SP:	Sixty people seventy maybe≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah  cause I look around and like  there's so many empty 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Chairs 
SP:	No I definitely feel the same way 
	 
SP:	Um 
	 
SP:	but yeah no thanks so it's going well I think that's that hasn't really been a problem  I kinda want to do the  assignment  this weekend 
SP:	um 
	 
SP:	Mhm 
SP:	Assignment one  to get it out of the way 
	 
SP:	It  does not look very difficult 
	 
SP:	It doesn't you just need to find two articles and so I just need to spend the time to do that 
SP:	Mhm 
	 
SP:	um 
	 
SP:	Comp sci has been like 
	 
SP:	Comp eleven yeah 

	 
SP:	Yeah has been 
SP:	Do you like it or 
SP:	Yeah I like it it  it feels so good to like  finally get your program  Working 
SP:	Finish your code 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Mhm 
SP:	Like after just struggling through it and like getting  getting back syntax errors and  um 
	 
SP:	Like oh and just or just like having it not work at all 
SP:	yeah 
SP:	kinda like having to figure out why  um  but 
	 
SP:	I feel like I'd like that class 
SP:	It 
SP:	I yeah I think you would  >it's definitely it<  definitely takes time 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Yeah I like that 
SP:	Like it's definitely like gets 
SP:	definitely a week's worth of work  cause like you gotta s- like the way it works is you get assigned Homework on  Thursday 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Mhm 
	 
SP:	and then basically you have n- till next Thursday to do it all 
	 
SP:	um so 
	 
SP:	h- How do you guys have like midterms and stuff in the 
SP:	I don't know I'm kind of scared because like coding takes me awhile and if we have to do like coding in class 
SP:	mm there's no I don't really  think they make you do that 
SP:	I hope not  I don't know I I  have to ask Henry see what they did 
	 
SP:	He's a he's a comp sci major right≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah he's in comp fifteen right now 
	 
SP:	I hear that fucking difficult≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
	 
SP:	I'm sure 
	 
SP:	Yeah I wanted to take  I actually wanted to take comp eleven this semester 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	I decided  to take calc three instead I'll just take it cause I didn't want to take both 
	 
SP:	yeah that's Probably smart move 
SP:	Um 
SP:	Yeah  so I'll take it probably in the fall 
	 
SP:	Yeah I w-  wanted to take comp ten  just cause it was like  it's like comp eleven except  not for majors 
	 
SP:	like comp sci majors so it's likeA lot more easy going 
SP:	yeah 
SP:	but  I l- I literally showed up for the class  the first week back and 
	 
SP:	Like I get there and  there are  the class is just absolutely packed 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Like everyone on the waitlist showed up 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Um so we were like twenty people over capacity 
SP:	Geez  how big is the class 
	 
SP:	not that big I think it was only supposed to hold like  thirty thirty five people 
SP:	mhm yeah 
SP:	mm But there ended up being like  fifty people there 
SP:	damn 
	 
SP:	Um 
	 
SP:	e- 
	 
SP:	s- But like I was looking around and I'm pretty sure I was the only freshman in that room 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Um 
	 
SP:	And so  yeah he like at the end fo class he was like gonna try and like  um find a bigger room so like he could accommodate all the people that wanted to take the class which is like cool but then like you got an email from people saying like no we can't  give you a bigger room you need to  just Say no 
SP:	They needed to cap the classes 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈That makes sense 
	 
SP:	Unfortunately 
	 
SP:	But you know I  how do you like the guy I heard he's  a little bit of a character 
SP:	Which one≈ 

SP:	≈The comp sci guy 
	 
SP:	uh oh the professor 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Yeah  he 
	 
SP:	Yeah He's 
	 
SP:	Definitely interesting 
	 
SP:	He 
	 
SP:	I don't know it's like hard to describe he's 
	 
SP:	He's definitely he's very smart 
SP:	mhm 
SP:	that's  for sure um  and 
	 
SP:	He's like 
	 
SP:	His sense of humor is kind of like 
	 
SP:	That's so  funny 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	It's kind of like a  computer and away  he  um 
	 
SP:	Where they keep because like computer science like at the end of each step laid out  um  and so it 
SP:	That's what is jokes so 
SP:	Yeah it kind of  so he  oh 
	 
SP:	He's like  he always flexes like out cannot process because  blank is 
	 
SP:	It's hard 
	 
SP:	What what  does he like go through coding class there 
SP:	Hi it's more like the concept so like how to make  how to do repetition  uhm in like how to make the  code do the same thing over and over for like an X amount of times  um  um so it's more like  bigger concepts like that  last class  which is a fully like kinda went through how the computer thought about it or like  you have  basically every code and then 
SP:	Mhm 
	 
SP:	Your word  yeah you have your code and then 
	 
SP:	A lot of what coding is is functions which is like  code inside of  it's like 
	 
SP:	At this  it's a string with like code inside of it so if you call the function than the code that's inside the functional run and you'll get like at 
	 
SP:	Oh put≈ 
SP:	≈So like  X squared for example≈ 
SP:	≈Sure 
SP:	Like that's that would be like a  he had the square function or whatever  if you like name your function like square and then wroteinside it how to  like 
SP:	Mhm 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Then  uhm basically when you call a function  M  that'll run  the what ask you to like input the number and then a like run the  code and it'll  uhm give you a number back  and so  he like to basically talked about how the computer will 
	 
SP:	Kind of  for each action within that  uhm within the code inside the  function  it a like  um so if you wanted it to print  hi or whatever it like  create an activation record  for print 
SP:	Mhm 
	 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	And then it will a good  like  analyze what it wants to print  to be like okay once we print I can do that 
SP:	Okay 
SP:	It'll  send that back 
	 
SP:	It's pretty cool≈ 
SP:	≈It'll print that and then activation record will go away and 
	 
SP:	It 
	 
SP:	I don't know it that the special just gonna help me  like wrap my head around  uhm 
	 
SP:	Like what the computer is actually doing  did the we're doing 
SP:	Yeah it's definitely it's definitely really cool field like my dad like 
	 
SP:	I was like  no like I'm helping pay for  a college education this is the one causing did say 
SP:	Yeah≈ 
SP:	≈Which is caught like comp eleven 
SP:	I mean its fair 
SP:	Uhm 
	 
SP:	That's so that's for Yeah 
SP:	No no no and I like wanna take it anyway≈ 
SP:	≈Yeah 
SP:	Thank you I think it was like kind of joking but 
	 
SP:	My dad thinks it yeah the same way it thinks it  should all 
	 
SP:	Uhm≈ 
SP:	≈Just so it's like  for everybody like understand like  even though like or even a couple of is just like the basics right yet see plus plus 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	Oh well we're doing python antsy both of 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	But like so I could  just  like now like you since you're able to code and both of those  it like enables you to do jobs were like which like eighty percent coat eighty eighty percent noncoding but like twenty percent cutting 
SP:	Yeah  apparently after 
	 
SP:	Comp eleven and comp fifteen were at like an employable level of 
	 
SP:	Really 
	 
SP:	That's  that's what someone told me around it's very 
SP:	That's pretty cool 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	You're gonna keep gonna 
	 
SP:	Oh sell the rest of us are you has 
SP:	The 
	 
SP:	Uhm  figured out from here 
	 
SP:	>Definitely< 
	 
SP:	So taken is intro to finance class with the 
	 
SP:	My profession and David just go 
	 
SP:	He's like this guy who's never top before  he's a tufts alarm 
	 
SP:	And he worked in finance for like 
SP:	Thirty years whatever and I was teaching us he's such a character it's hilarious 
SP:	Wow ok 
	 
SP:	He's not he's a really funny 
SP:	Wait 
SP:	It's good 
	 
SP:	He's he's also he's actually like a good teacher like 
SP:	Is he a good teacher 
	 
SP:	Feel like a lot of those people are like  >I<  don't really know how the T a yard like it is it's like knowing the information doesn't enable you to teach the information≈ 
SP:	≈That's true 
	 
SP:	Right it's like 
	 
SP:	How will you convey it to people who don't know 
SP:	Exactly and so using like techniques 
	 
SP:	To try and like 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	We only did yeah exactly just like demonstrated in a way that makes sense  uhm 
	 
SP:	Yeah  or 
	 
SP:	Yeah he's he's doing a good job of doctor it's really it's a really instinct us 
SP:	What do you what he is doing  when you learn about 
SP:	So we start off with like  my present future value of money 
	 
SP:	Okay 
	 
SP:	um  so is the that that part has been pretty like equation happy 
	 
SP:	The question  yeah≈ 
SP:	≈So it's Bella Akeno 
	 
SP:	F V was Peavey times the rate 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	<To like> 
SP:	RT or whatever≈ 
SP:	≈To anticipate yet uhm you 
SP:	Yeah 
	 
SP:	That  piano which is like period's and 
SP:	Yeah 
SP:	Then as the years≈ 
