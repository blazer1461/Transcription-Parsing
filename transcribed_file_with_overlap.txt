SP2: ⌊didn't think about it that⌋ way  _1480334_1481560
SP2: The gyms  _1482151_1482843
SP1: yeah  _1483241_1483525
SP2: Keep the (.) s Tufts students healthy  _1484015_1486680
SP1: let's fight obesity (.) let's put a giant hill right here  _1487312_1489902
SP1: That'll help  _1491174_1491587
SP2: So after you work out you have to walk up hill again  _1491891_1494540
SP1: Might have killer calves  _1494749_1495817
SP2: oh yeah  _1495950_1496480
SP1: That's the whole goal  _1497049_1497773
SP2: ugh  _1498590_1499040
SP1: like if I had a set three goals for my entire time at Tufts (0.4) the top (0.2) three goals would all be to get killer calves  _1498657_1504040
SP2: I feel like (.) wa I have to every time I'm our field is down hill  _1504909_1508510
SP1: ⌈Okay⌉  _1508844_1509189
SP2: ⌊so⌋ like everyday (0.4) the walk from  _1509113_1511631
SP2: Craft (0.3) to Hill is just miserable well it's not miserable but it's so far  _1513691_1518508
SP1: Yeah  _1518595_1518946
SP2: And three days a week I have French ⌈right after pr⌉actice  _1519099_1521831
SP1: ⌊ooo⌋  _1521103_1521531
SP2: so either way I'm going like all the way to Olin  _1522157_1524364
SP1: it's far  _1524990_1525676
SP2: and it's just miserable  _1524998_1526490
SP2: It's so far  _1526634_1527580
SP1: Yeah  _1527770_1528063
SP2: especially now that it's cold (1.0) it's pretty bad  _1528229_1531036
SP1: but Being uphill has its benefits because if you're not going all the way down hill before class (.) like you're (0.3) at the same level as the classes ⌈like I have to ⌉walk uphill to every class  _1531622_1539689
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1538065_1538590
SP2: That's true  _1540311_1540980
SP1: and have (0.3) enough of a break time in between classes where I have to go back to my dorm to like (.) do like ⌈do work and do⌉ things  _1541298_1547117
SP2: ⌊mhm⌋  _1546293_1546797
SP2: Yeah  _1547259_1547533
SP1: And then go back to class so I'm walking uphill like three or four times a day ⌈minimum⌉  _1547546_1550899
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋ where are most of your classes  _1550876_1552720
SP1: um (0.8) probably like they're in the academic quad mostly  _1553611_1557169
SP2: Okay  _1557410_1557870
SP1: But um (0.3) it's nice I have one class in Granoff so  _1557944_1560968
SP2: ⌈uhuh⌉  _1561133_1561586
SP1: ⌊I⌋ don't have to walk very far for that  _1561554_1562661
SP2: That's nice (0.4) yeah mine is I've one in Granoff too and then  _1562765_1566331
SP2: I have one in Eaton ⌈so tha⌉t's Kinda  _1567635_1570280
SP1: ⌊Okay⌋  _1569268_1569600
SP2: I don't know what that counts as  _1570917_1572270
SP1: think it's still the academic quad  _1572579_1573722
SP2: Yeah (0.5) and then Olin and then psych  _1573970_1576500
SP1: Yeah  _1577135_1577481
SP2: So  _1577820_1578230
SP1: Not bad  _1579219_1579600
SP2: Not bad  _1579756_1580350
SP1: it works out  _1580610_1581113
SP2: Yeah I feel like if I were coming from Hil (0.9) Oli like (.) going to Olin and going to psych would be so easy  _1581333_1587999
SP1: Yeah  _1588154_1588523
SP2: But like Eaton in (0.6) Granoff doesn't really ap (0.4) matter  _1588711_1592166
SP1: Yeah ⌈Granoff's really easy for me⌉  _1592660_1594110
SP2: ⌊It would be the same from anywhere⌋  _1592993_1594404
SP2: yeah  _1595306_1595680
SP1: cause it's like a one minute walk from Hodge  _1595313_1597371
SP2: Yeah (0.9) I have four classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays  _1597436_1601289
SP1: Really  _1601378_1601810
SP2: But then on I have no classes Wednesday (0.6) and I only have one class on Monday and Friday (0.5) so it's like a weird like I a (0.3) pretty much always have a four day weekend  _1601951_1611800
SP1: that works  _1612259_1612748
SP2: Which is nice  _1613005_1613819
SP1: Yeah I set up my classes differently I have (0.2) two on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday  _1614403_1618970
SP2: ⌈Okay⌉  _1619311_1619785
SP1: ⌊And⌋⌋then I have one recitation on Friday  _1619599_1621253
SP2: That's nice  _1621900_1622703
SP1: um so it works ⌈out⌉  _1622732_1623702
SP2: ⌊that's⌋ really evenly broken up  _1623561_1625120
SP1: Yeah (0.5) and I thought that would be beneficial (0.3) it's not  _1625226_1628659
SP2: You don't like it  _1628702_1629394
SP1: it just means I have work due every day  _1628751_1630044
SP2: yeah (0.6) that's what (0.2) I like about having Wednesdays off  _1630403_1634198
SP1: mhm  _1634439_1634749
SP2: cause like I don't really have to do stuff Tuesday night  _1634882_1637860
SP1: Yeah  _1638341_1638682
SP2: But like I can if I wanna get ahead and then I don't have to do anything Thursday nights  _1639030_1642462
SP1: That ⌈works⌉  _1643076_1643612
SP2: ⌊Like⌋ I would do it again I think (0.3) but I also end up wasting a lot of time (0.3) cause my classes like if I don't I don't have class till six PM on Monday (0.3)  _1643586_1650908
SP2: so I end up just like sleeping in too late  _1651319_1654450
SP1: Really  _1651390_1651856
SP2: But (0.8) you get you get you get  _1655611_1658125
SP1: Yeah I mean I have class at nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays I hate that  _1658146_1661940
SP2: Yeah  _1662279_1662730
SP1: And it's so early  _1662336_1663220
SP2: I have (.) yeah I have I have that too  _1663920_1666170
SP1: And ⌈it's weird cause ⌉like I had to wake up to be at school at eight in high school  _1666266_1669544
SP2: ⌊I have English⌋  _1666408_1667105
SP2: ⌈mhm⌉  _1669806_1670364
SP1: ⌊Like I thought⌋ that was early and I think this is early even though it's later  _1669996_1672633
SP2: Yeah like getting up at eight  _1672680_1674081
SP1: I think it's  _1674330_1674850
SP2: like I get up at eight for my nine ams  _1674393_1676188
SP1: Yeah  _1676282_1676674
SP2: I feel like next semster I'm gonna try and go for (0.2) everything after ten  _1677106_1680350
SP1: yeah for sure  _1680530_1681346
SP2: Especially cause now like at least (0.3) first semester I can't have any classes between (0.5) three (.) and (0.6) five six (.) three and six so like I have the that whole chunk of time likeI couldn't put anything in my schedule for that but ⌈now I'm more⌉ flexible  _1681568_1696607
SP1: ⌊that makes sense⌋  _1695430_1696086
SP1: Yeah cause of soccer sports yeah  _1697456_1699066
SP2: Yeah but I'm still trying to have Wednesdays off (0.7) it's really nice cause it's like it breaks ⌈up the week⌉  _1699126_1704917
SP1: ⌊it breaks up⌋⌋the week yeah that would be (0.3) that would be probably the most beneficial day to have ⌈off⌉  _1704414_1708517
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋ it's like you don't like Fridays off are nice but having one class on Fridays isn't the end of the world  _1708454_1713354
SP1: no I have a rescitation that's ⌈not mandator⌉y  _1713414_1715622
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1715104_1715579
SP1: and ⌈like its⌉  _1715742_1716539
SP2: ⌊what for⌋⌋what class ⌈is it⌉  _1716101_1717260
SP1: ⌊for⌋ stats  _1717096_1717740
SP2: ⌈Okay⌉  _1718064_1718510
SP1: ⌊Um⌋⌋(0.4) I only have to show up (.) if like when I pressing questions or to like we're actually learning something and ⌈they tell us⌉ in advance  _1718386_1725021
SP2: ⌊mhm⌋  _1724108_1724525
SP2: Okay  _1725345_1725840
SP1: Um so that helps  _1726140_1727410
SP2: yeah do you do so do each your classes only meet twice a ⌈week except sta⌉  _1727639_1731230
SP1: ⌊e yes except⌋ for stats which has three  _1730546_1732567
SP1: Including rescitation  _1732791_1733668
SP2: Okay  _1732853_1733301
SP2: okay  _1734022_1734423
SP1: But yeah (0.4) it's nice  _1734736_1735998
SP2: Yeah  _1736481_1736964
SP1: One of my friends has rescitations for all of his classes  _1737219_1739670
SP2: Uhhuh  _1740027_1740450
SP1: And he's constantly going from like class to recitation to class I ⌈mean⌉  _1740510_1743678
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1743664_1744270
SP1: and Like he didn't do a good job spreading out his recitations either  _1743678_1746277
SP2: mhm  _1746391_1746907
SP1: on Fridays he has three classes and and which are all recitations and are all mandatory  _1746997_1750640
SP2: oh my gosh (0.8) I'm worried for next semester cause I'm trying to take five classes  _1750837_1755910
SP1: Same though  _1756323_1756887
SP2: And then like (.) most of them like (0.2) if I take econ I'll have a rescitation  _1757213_1761107
SP1: Okay  _1761130_1761480
SP2: French two will have a ⌈rescitat⌉ion  _1761528_1763440
SP1: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1762951_1763260
SP2: I wanna take computer science  _1765210_1766660
SP1: I do too but I don't know when I want to take it  _1766935_1768673
SP2: I ⌈know⌉  _1768752_1769600
SP1: ⌊Like⌋ I want to take next semester but I feel like next semester's like when everyone who didn't take it first semester's gonna take it  _1769452_1774830
SP2: I know  _1774899_1775400
SP1: I don't it want to be a super busy clas I want to be able to like learn ⌈well for that class⌉ ⌉  _1775525_1778650
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1777992_1778578
SP2: I've just heard that there's like one really really good professor and one who is not good at all  _1778688_1782912
SP1: well I don't know which is which  _1783140_1784173
SP2: I know I need to figure it out too my one friend ⌈was like⌉  _1784210_1786818
SP1: ⌊Rate my⌋ professor  _1786541_1787358
SP2: Yeah  _1787506_1787945
SP1: work works really well  _1787537_1788437
SP2: that is a good one  _1788759_1789695
SP2: my one friend told me like if you take it with her you're golden but you can't take it with this person or whatever  _1789979_1795170
SP1: Yeah  _1790039_1790350
SP1: ⌈That works⌉  _1795885_1796540
SP2: ⌊So we'll see⌋  _1796010_1796673
SP1: Yeah  _1797025_1797379
SP2: Yeah  _1798651_1798883
SP1: I don't ⌈know⌉  _1798703_1799030
SP2: ⌊I⌋ I just don't know like my next semester is going to be so much worse than this one was  _1798975_1802732
SP1: Yeah that's how I feel  _1803015_1803970
SP2: But  _1804077_1804325
SP1: I took four pretty easy classes  _1804663_1806113
SP2: ⌈Yeah me too⌉  _1806149_1806983
SP1: ⌊Or classes that don't⌋ have a lot of work  _1806418_1807753
SP2: ⌈Yeah⌉  _1807942_1808298
SP1: ⌊so⌋ (0.7) ⌈ah⌉  _1808233_1809864
SP2: ⌊Like⌋ psych is work heavy but it's ⌈like conceptually⌉  _1809777_1812822
SP1: ⌊It;s reading ⌈heavy⌉⌋  _1811982_1813024
SP2: ⌊it's⌋ reading ⌈heavy⌉  _1812967_1813934
SP1: ⌊which⌋ takes a long time but isn't that hard  _1813744_1815680
SP2: Yeah and like I feel like (.) my notes I'm so particular about how I take my notes that it takes even longer like  _1815766_1821928
SP1: Do you take notes and read at that like you take notes while you read  _1822002_1824470
SP2: So (0.5) I like have tried everything (.) like (0.3) oh I used to go paragraph by paragraph which I know you're not supposed to do  _1824860_1831206
SP1: mhm  _1831287_1831594
SP2: but (0.2) so then like this past time for chapter eight I would read through  _1831880_1835852
SP2: All of eight point one (0.5) like eight one A B C or whatever (0.3) and then go back and take notes on the whole thing so like I knew (0.4) like I didn't have to re read each paragraph  _1836860_1846731
SP2: I ⌈kinda knew⌉ what was going on  _1846731_1847940
SP1: ⌊Okay⌋  _1846825_1847199
SP2: Um but that (.) took me like pretty much an hour for each like nine one nine two nine ⌈three nine⌉ four  _1848780_1854790
SP1: ⌊Really⌋  _1854083_1854480
SP2: Like I sat in Tisch from (0.4) seven to eleven (  _1855756_1858500
SP1: Damn  _1858785_1859111
SP2: doing psych [ ]  _1858848_1859560
SP1: ⌈that's that's tough⌉  _1860037_1861292
SP2: ⌊And it's like it's⌋⌋such a (0.4) it's like not a waste a time but like (0.6) I could have been (.) I feel like there's got to be a better way to do it  _1860443_1867310
SP1: See I don't take notes at all when I read cause I'll just get distracted by it like I'll be a so focused on the notes ⌈versus the read⌉ing  _1867640_1873412
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1872727_1873292
SP1: and I won't learn as much ⌈from it⌉  _1873412_1874853
SP2: ⌊uh⌋ huh  _1874696_1875120
SP1: I like to just read through everything and then they have a little study guide things built ⌈into the text bo⌉ok ⌉  _1875282_1880397
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1879595_1880220
SP1: and I'll go back and do those after  _1880455_1881655
SP1: Just so I really ⌈master it⌉  _1881975_1883240
SP2: ⌊Like⌋⌋the the ⌈quizzes or the⌉  _1882830_1884910
SP1: ⌊Yeah like a⌋⌋ flash cards and quizzes I can go back and do ⌈those⌉  _1884368_1887247
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋ (.) maybe I'll try that for chapter ten  _1887209_1889242
SP1: Yeah  _1890110_1890519
SP2: Like I just feel like if I get through chapter nine I'll be fine (0.3) cause ⌈ten is ⌉like the most recent thing we're learning  _1890120_1895400
SP1: ⌊yeah⌋  _1893425_1893677
SP1: Yeah  _1895167_1895512
SP2: And then I'll just be able to like (0.6) I can just review extra for it  _1895918_1899455
SP1: Yeah  _1899598_1899900
SP2: for test on Thursday  _1899610_1901760
SP1: That works it's the balance that I just take like really (0.3) like (0.3) really affected notes in class  _1901985_1906506
SP2: ⌈Yeah⌉  _1906627_1907116
SP1: ⌊or⌋ I'll write down more than I necessarily  _1907029_1908821
SP2: Yeah  _1909030_1909400
SP1: but just so I have it  _1909484_1910240
SP2: Yeah  _1910613_1911000
SP1: ⌈Yeah⌉  _1911675_1911920
SP2: ⌊I⌋ feel like  _1911894_1912482
SP2: My class notes could be better (0.6) but it's also like I (0.6) I feel like I (.) don't pay as much attention (0.3) in class because I know I have the reading to fall back on  _1914290_1923600
SP1: Okay yeah  _1923686_1924269
SP2: But like that's not good like I need to be paying attention in class but ⌈we'll see⌉  _1924478_1928930
SP1: ⌊I get⌋ that sometimes there are some there are some like lectures and chapters or at least part of a lecture I'm like (0.3) okay I I I g (.) I not really getting right now ⌈just like go fo⌉r further reading  _1928723_1938041

SP1: ⌈this d⌉oesn't make as much sense anymore  _1942300_1946367
SP2: ⌊mhm⌋  _1942456_1942945

SP2: ⌈⌊Yeah⌉⌋  _1959959_1960590
SP1: ⌊from the first⌋ one we know how to do it  _1960044_1961631
SP2: Yes and like (0.3) it's not as much it's not as specific I feel like ⌈the mat⌉erial ⌉  _1961719_1966446
SP1: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1965725_1966040
SP2: it's more ⌈theories and⌉ like vague stuff  _1966486_1969412
SP1: ⌊A little more vague⌋  _1967300_1968170
SP2: whereas like (0.6) last time we had to know like all the different ⌈function⌉s  _1969891_1973546
SP1: ⌊yeah⌋  _1973143_1973480

SP1: Yeah (0.8) or like you get  _1165099_1167021
SP1: But if you got like a (.) like they give you like a card you like show it every time you go in and they like keep track of how many people (0.5) are (0.9) um (0.8) and like the movie theater keeps track of like each (.) everyone who shows like the card (.) what this (0.4) like that says you have this subscription and then um  _1169260_1186290
SP2: yeah  _1186348_1186716
SP1: And then basically you get  _1187226_1188331

SP2: It (0.3) does not look very difficult  _1393880_1395760
SP1: It doesn't you just need to find two articles and so I just need to spend the time to do that  _1396024_1399272

SP1: um  _1400268_1400886

SP2: Comp eleven yeah  _1405880_1406730
SP1: Yeah has been  _1407057_1407930
SP2: Do you like it or  _1408103_1408848
SP1: Yeah I like it it (0.9) it feels so good to like (.) ⌈finally get your p⌉rogram ⌉ Working  _1409000_1415317

SP2: Mhm  _1415402_1415797
SP1: Like after just struggling through it and like getting (0.9) getting back syntax errors and (0.7) um  _1415974_1422040
SP1: Like oh and just or just like having it not work ⌈at all⌉  _1423210_1426480
SP2: ⌊yeah⌋  _1426130_1426600
SP1: kinda like having to figure out why (0.6) um (1.0) but  _1426858_1430893

SP1: I yeah I think you would (0.3) it's definitely it (0.3) definitely takes time  _1434745_1438033
SP2: Yeah  _1438235_1438590
SP1: Yeah I ⌈like that⌉  _1438930_1440162

SP1: um so  _1452137_1454010
SP2: h How do you guys have like midterms and stuff in the  _1454705_1457593
SP1: I don't know I'm kind of scared because like coding takes me awhile and if we have to do like coding in ⌈class⌉  _1457717_1463420
SP2: ⌊mm there's⌋ no I don't really (.) think they make you do that  _1463266_1465633
SP1: I hope not (0.3) I don't know I I (1.0) have to ask Henry see what they did  _1465741_1470160
SP2: He's a he's a comp sci major right  _1471539_1472790
SP1: Yeah he's in comp fifteen right now  _1472801_1474080
SP2: I hear that fucking difficult  _1474590_1475886
SP1: Yeah  _1475962_1476220
SP1: I'm sure  _1476836_1477382
SP2: Yeah I wanted to take (.) I actually wanted to take comp eleven this semester  _1478373_1481860
SP1: Yeah  _1482070_1482480
SP2: I decided (0.2) to take calc three instead I'll just take it cause I didn't want to take both  _1482700_1486808
SP1: yeah ⌈that's Probably ⌉smart move  _1487121_1488894
SP2: ⌊Um⌋  _1487770_1488320
SP2: Yeah (.) so I'll take it probably in the fall  _1489014_1491107
SP1: Yeah I w (0.3) wanted to take comp ten (0.2) just cause it was like (0.5) it's like comp eleven except (0.6) not for majors  _1491756_1498499
SP1: like comp sci ⌈majors s⌉o it's likeA lot more easy going  _1498769_1502020
SP2: ⌊yeah⌋  _1499773_1500110
SP1: but (1.0) I l I literally showed up for the class (.) the first week back and  _1502020_1506983
SP1: Like I get there and (1.0) there are (1.0) the class is just absolutely packed  _1508050_1514280
SP2: ⌈Yeah⌉  _1514775_1515320
SP1: ⌊Like everyone⌋ on the waitlist showed up  _1514931_1516716
SP2: Yeah  _1517032_1517422
SP1: Um so we were like twenty people over capacity  _1517517_1519971
SP2: Geez (.) how big is the class  _1520069_1521630
SP1: not that big I think it was only supposed to hold like (0.4) thirty thirty five ⌈people⌉  _1523552_1528140
SP2: ⌊mhm⌋ ⌈yeah⌉  _1528004_1528690
SP1: ⌊mm But⌋ there ended up being like (0.3) fifty people there  _1528393_1531410

SP1: Um  _1532270_1532802
SP1: e  _1533978_1534026
SP1: s But like I was looking around and I'm pretty sure I was the only freshman in that room  _1535092_1538449
SP2: Yeah  _1538703_1539190
SP1: Um  _1539558_1540090
SP1: And so (0.9) yeah he like at the end fo class he was like gonna try and like (0.3) um find a bigger room so like he could accommodate all the people that wanted to take the class which is like cool but then like you got an email from people saying like no we can't (0.2) give you a bigger room you need to (.) ⌈just Say no⌉  _1541399_1557720
SP2: ⌊They needed⌋ to cap the classes  _1557270_1558730

SP2: That makes sense  _1559217_1559840
SP1: Unfortunately  _1561544_1562628
SP2: But you know I (.) how do you like the guy I heard he's (0.3) a little bit of a character  _1562901_1567001
SP1: Which one  _1567232_1567741
SP2: The comp sci guy  _1567813_1568729
SP1: uh oh the ⌈professor⌉  _1569496_1570920
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1570790_1571180
SP1: Yeah (0.2) he  _1571421_1572407

SP1: Definitely interesting  _1575240_1576360
SP1: He  _1578980_1579374
SP1: I don't know it's like hard to describe he's  _1580623_1583300

SP2: ⌈mhm⌉  _1586086_1586382
SP1: ⌊that's⌋ (.) for sure um (0.9) and  _1586245_1589420
SP1: He's like  _1591685_1592269
SP1: His sense of humor is kind of like  _1595243_1597704
SP1: That's so (0.4) ⌈funny⌉  _1603812_1604940
SP2: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1604849_1605334
SP1: It's kind of like a (0.8) computer and away (0.3) he (0.8) um  _1606057_1611490
SP1: Where they keep because like computer science like at the end of each step laid out (0.4) um (0.3) ⌈and so it⌉  _1612813_1618760
SP2: ⌊That's what⌋ is jokes so  _1618310_1619410
SP1: Yeah it kind of (0.6) so he (0.8) oh  _1619650_1623370
SP1: He's like (0.3) he always flexes like out cannot process because (0.4) blank is  _1624735_1630590
SP1: It's hard  _1631020_1632000
SP2: What what (0.2) does he like go through coding class there  _1632477_1635522
SP1: Hi it's more like the concept so like how to make (0.3) how to do repetition (0.6) um in like how to make the (.) code do the same thing over and over for like an X amount of times (0.5) um (0.8) um so it's more like (0.2) bigger concepts like that ⌈(0.5) las⌉t class (.) which is a fully like kinda went through how the computer thought about it or like (0.7) you have (1.0) basically every code and then  _1635631_1661560
SP2: ⌊Mhm⌋  _1651983_1652269
SP1: Your word (0.9) yeah you have your code and then  _1662815_1666280
SP1: A lot of what coding is is functions which is like (0.3) code inside of (0.6) it's like  _1667886_1673220
SP1: At this (0.4) it's a string with like code inside of it so if you call the function than the code that's inside the functional run and you'll get like at  _1673968_1682850
SP2: Oh put  _1683500_1684018
SP1: So like (0.5) X squared for example  _1684090_1686382
SP2: Sure  _1686388_1686662
SP1: Like that's that would be like a (0.3) he ⌈had th⌉e square function or whatever (0.5) if you like name your function like square and then wroteinside it how to (.) like  _1686857_1700783
SP2: ⌊Mhm⌋  _1690632_1690924
SP2: Yeah  _1700854_1701210
SP1: Then (0.4) um basically when you call a function (0.6) M (.) that'll run (0.6) the what ask you to like input the number and then a like run the (.) code and it'll (0.8) um give you a number back (0.6) and so (0.4) he like to basically talked about how the computer will  _1701442_1719290
SP1: Kind of (0.8) for each action within that (0.6) um within the code inside the (.) function ⌈(.) ⌉it a like (0.9) um so if you wanted it to print (0.6) hi or whatever it like (0.3) create an activation record (0.4) for print  _1720750_1736000
SP2: ⌊Mhm⌋  _1727075_1727374
SP2: Yeah  _1736278_1736540
SP1: And then it will a good (0.3) like (0.2) analyze what it wants to print (0.6) to be like okay once we print I can do that  _1736311_1742515
SP2: ⌈Okay⌉  _1742692_1742980
SP1: ⌊It'll⌋ (.) send that back  _1742820_1744401
SP2: It's pretty cool  _1745101_1745550
SP1: It'll print that and then activation record will go away and  _1745616_1748540
SP1: It  _1750614_1750820
SP1: I don't know it that the special just gonna help me (0.7) like wrap my head around (0.4) um  _1752181_1757120
SP1: Like what the computer is actually doing (.) ⌈did the we're doing⌉  _1758209_1760720
SP2: ⌊Yeah it's definitely⌋ it's definitely really cool field like my dad like  _1759993_1763197

SP1: Yeah  _1770302_1770698
SP2: Which is caught like comp eleven  _1770742_1772140
SP1: I mean its fair  _1772287_1772990
SP2: Uhm  _1773117_1773712
SP1: That's so that's ⌈for Yeah⌉  _1774700_1776064

SP1: Uhm  _1784988_1785460
SP2: Just so it's like (0.2) for everybody like understand like (0.4) even though like or even a couple of is just like the ⌈basics right yet⌉ see plus plus  _1785508_1792980
SP1: ⌊Yeah⌋  _1791720_1792280
