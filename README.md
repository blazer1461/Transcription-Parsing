# Transcription-Parsing
Spencer Ha- Human Interaction Lab 

Parses through .cha files in a directory and removes all special characters and CA (Conversation Analysis)
The difference could be seen when looking at transcribed_file.txt vs original_transcribed_file.txt.


When running transcirption_main.py which is the main python file, be sure to edit line 13 to the directory that
has all the .cha files.
